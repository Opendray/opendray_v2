# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenDray v2 are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Version numbers follow this project's own **major-as-generation**
strategy: major version = product generation, minor = feature
iteration, patch = fix / polish. See [VERSIONING.md](./VERSIONING.md)
for the full rationale and what triggers a major bump.

## [Unreleased]

## [v2.15.1], 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Grok sessions now scroll cleanly on desktop and mobile. Grok used to open
  in its fullscreen mode, which has no scrollback and ignores the mouse
  wheel, so scrolling was erratic on desktop and impossible on phones and
  tablets. Grok now opens in its scrollback native mode, so the wheel and
  finger swipe scroll the conversation the same way they do for Claude.
  (#546)

## [v2.15.0], 2026-09-05

### Added

- Grok account switching can now carry the conversation across the switch,
  matching Claude. Switching a running grok session to another account with
  "carry over conversation context" turned on seeds the new account's fresh
  session with a recap of your recent conversation. It is opt in and
  consent gated: the recap is sent to the provider under the new account,
  which the confirm dialog states before you switch. (#542, #543, #544)

## [v2.14.1], 2026-09-04

### Added

- Grok accounts get a full UI: a Grok accounts panel in the Providers page
  (list, import local, enable or disable, remove) and live account
  switching from the session header, matching Claude and Antigravity. This
  surfaces the grok multi-account backend that shipped in v2.14.0. (#539)
- Opt-in git worktree isolation, so concurrent sessions can each work in
  their own worktree without stepping on one another. (#531)
- Mobile can reach a gateway behind Cloudflare Access without a VPN. (#538)

### Changed

- Documentation rewritten in plain, human prose with no em dashes, the
  README simplified so it reads top to bottom in one pass, and the
  changelog brought up to date. (#537, #528, #536)

## [v2.14.0], 2026-08-31

Grok catches up. You can pool several xAI accounts, bind one to a session,
and switch a running grok session from one account to another **without
losing the session**, the multi-account parity Claude and Antigravity
already had. Each account is an isolated `GROK_HOME`; the heavy install and
cache directories are shared across accounts by symlink, so a second
account costs kilobytes, not gigabytes.

### Added

- Grok multi-account: pool accounts, pick one per session, and live-switch
  a running session between them (`PATCH /sessions/{id}/grok-account`)
  without dropping it. Each account is an isolated `GROK_HOME`; MCP trust is
  per-account and the heavy install/cache dirs are shared by symlink.
  (#533, #534, #535)
- Cortex spawn injections (memory guidance, ambient memory, skills) now
  reach grok too, coalesced into grok's single `--rules`. (#530)

## [v2.13.3], 2026-08-22

The one-line installer runs to the end again, as root, on a fresh Proxmox
LXC or VPS, which is exactly how it is usually run. And Cortex, the
knowledge layer, grows a lifecycle: operator edits stick, a page can be
handed to an in-session agent, proposals are reviewed as a diff, and the
sweep respects a page's approval gate.

### Added

- Cortex knowledge lifecycle: durable operator edits, polarity,
  deletion-as-signal, and conflict execution. (#521)
- Hand a knowledge page to in-session agents (#513); review proposals as a
  diff instead of two full documents (#515); let the sweep honour a page's
  approval gate (#516).
- Tasks grouped by project in the management views. (#520)
- Git: an "Update branch" action so a stale PR can be merged from opendray. (#518)

### Fixed

- Installer: root installs never completed: the Postgres readiness gate
  always failed as root (`run_priv -u postgres` ran a literal `-u`), and
  `migrate` ran with `HOME=/root` so its backup keyfile was unreadable. The
  one-liner now runs to the end. (#529)
- Mobile: a knowledge proposal is reviewable before you decide on it. (#519)
- Cortex: `doc_read`'s framing is no longer written into pages. (#517)
- Catalog: compare resolved paths when detecting non-npm bin links. (#514)

## [v2.13.2], 2026-08-11

The Vault stops being a flat pile of markdown. It holds a folder
structure you maintain, files each project under its own name, and
renders HTML documents as carefully as it renders markdown, from an
in-memory string in a sandboxed frame, with scripts off, because a
document that arrived by `git pull` is not your own writing.

The phone catches up with the browser. It can see whether your edits
reached the remote, browse by tag, follow `[[wiki links]]`, show what
links back, and start today's note, instead of being somewhere you
could only read what you had written elsewhere. The admin UI itself
now fits a phone screen, which it never did.

### Added

- **The admin UI works on a phone and a tablet.** It was built for a
  desktop three-pane layout, which on a phone meant a horizontal
  scrollbar and two columns you could not reach. Every page now has a
  narrow form: below 1024px the third pane becomes a slide-over, below
  768px the list becomes the page until you pick something and the
  navigation tree follows it into a drawer. Tables, spacing and the
  topbar were sized to match.

  The drawer is one component rather than a pattern re-implemented per
  page, and it is reachable from a labelled control in the header,
  never from an edge handle alone, which is unreachable in practice.

- **The Vault syncs from the phone.** Repository status, a manual
  commit / push / pull, and the auto-sync settings are all on the
  phone now; previously the mobile app could edit documents but not
  see whether they had reached the remote, so the answer to "did that
  save get anywhere" was only available on a desktop.

- **The mobile Vault has the knowledge layer the web has had.** It
  could create, read, edit, rename and delete a document, but nothing
  that makes a vault more than a folder. It now browses by `#tag`,
  shows a document's backlinks and its tags, follows `[[wiki links]]`,
  completes them while you type, jumps by heading, and opens today's
  daily note from the same template the web writes.

  Two constraints worth knowing. The preview runs with JavaScript off,
  a document can arrive by `git pull`, so it is not the operator's
  own writing by default, which means wiki-links are anchors on a
  private scheme intercepted at navigation, and a heading jump lands
  in the source view rather than scrolling the rendered page. And the
  path rules are Unicode-aware on mobile: the web's ASCII-only
  sanitiser turns `笔记.md` into `--.md`.

- **The Vault stores and renders HTML documents, not just markdown.**
  Project documentation increasingly ships as HTML, exported from
  Notion or Word, generated by typedoc, asciidoc or Sphinx, and a doc
  library that cannot open those is a markdown library. `.html` /
  `.htm` are now first-class alongside `.md`: listed in the tree,
  creatable, movable, and rendered.

  **HTML is never served from opendray's own origin.** There is no
  endpoint returning a document as `text/html`; that would execute it
  same-origin with the admin session, so a file pulled from a git
  remote could take over the account. The body travels as a string
  through the existing JSON read and is rendered from memory in a
  sandboxed frame with an opaque origin. **Scripts are off by default**,
  exported documentation is static markup and renders identically
  without them, with a per-document opt-in for pages that genuinely
  run code, remembered locally per file.

  Mobile gains a rendered view for the first time. It previously showed
  only a document's source, which HTML would have made unreadable, so
  preview covers **both** kinds: markdown is converted and rendered
  through the same webview rather than drawn as native widgets, so the
  two formats look like one product.

  Deliberately not symmetric: `[[wiki links]]` are still scanned and
  rewritten in markdown only. An HTML document can be the *target* of
  one, but its own `<a href>` links are left alone. Rewriting those on
  a move is a different job, with relative paths, anchors and assets to
  get wrong. Auto-derived paths (daily, project, personal notes) stay
  markdown. And when a filename and a template disagree, `guide.html`
  from the markdown Blank template, the **filename wins**, since the
  operator chose the extension and the template was probably a default.

  In-document links work: clicking a table-of-contents entry scrolls to
  that heading, and only links that actually leave the document open a
  new tab. This needed more than it sounds like. See *Fixed* below.

### Fixed

- **Vault auto-sync settings could not be saved.** Whatever interval
  you set, the dialog snapped back to "every 10 minutes": the form
  refetched every 8 seconds and overwrote the draft mid-edit, so Save
  was never enabled and no setting had ever reached the database. The
  interval is now a free-text Go duration with presets, and the
  gateway rejects an unparseable one with a message instead of quietly
  substituting a default.

- **The mobile Vault's rename and delete were unfindable.** They
  existed, behind a long press on a row, with nothing on screen saying
  so, reported in testing as missing outright, which for a hidden
  gesture amounts to the same thing. Each row now carries a visible
  actions button in place of a chevron that did nothing the row did
  not already do, and the open editor offers rename and delete where
  the web has always had them.

- **Creating `guide.html` on the phone produced `guide.html.md`.** The
  new-document path appended `.md` unconditionally, so an HTML
  document could not be created from mobile at all.

- **Six hints rendered `&lt;prefix&gt;` as literal text** instead of
  `<prefix>`.

- **A table-of-contents link no longer loses the document.** In the web
  viewer, clicking an in-document `#anchor` navigated the frame away
  and rendered the opendray app *inside* the document view. A `srcdoc`
  frame's document URL is `about:srcdoc` while its base URL is
  inherited from the parent page, so `href="#install"` resolved against
  the gateway and became a real navigation. The base is now pinned to
  the frame's own document, which also stops a pulled document's
  relative URLs from resolving against the gateway's origin.

  The first attempt at "external links should open a new tab" used
  `<base target="_blank">`, which retargets *every* link, so a
  contents entry opened a blank tab instead of scrolling. Anchors are
  now rewritten individually: fragment links are left in place, an
  author's explicit `target` is respected, and only links leaving the
  document get `target="_blank"`. Generated documentation is precisely
  where this mattered: Sphinx, typedoc, asciidoc and Notion exports
  all ship a fragment contents list, and markdown footnotes render as
  fragment links too.

  Mobile deliberately does **not** pin a base: `loadData` makes the
  document's own URL and its base both `about:blank`, so fragments
  already resolve in place, and pinning would have introduced the bug
  rather than fixed it.

### Changed

- **CI no longer runs the whole suite twice on every branch commit.**
  A `feat/**` branch with an open PR matched both the `push` and
  `pull_request` triggers, and the concurrency group keys on the ref,
  which differs between the two events, so neither run cancelled the
  other. `push` is now main-only; `pull_request` already covered branch
  work.

- **A project's documents are filed under the project's name.** The
  Vault is a project documentation library, and it filed every project
  under `projects/`, a folder naming what the whole library already
  is. One level of nesting that told the reader nothing, on every path,
  in every listing, and at the top of the git repository the Vault syncs
  to. The operator's own notes were split off further still: agent docs
  at `projects/<name>/…`, the human scratchpad at `personal/<name>.md`,
  the same project's material in two distant places, sorted by *who
  wrote it* rather than by what it is about.

  New vaults now use `<name>/…` with that project's `personal.md`
  inside it. **Existing vaults are not rearranged.** The layout is
  decided once, at first start, and written into `config.toml` as
  `[vault] layout`. Recording it is the point: the alternative, work
  the shape out from what is on disk each time, is the bug that put
  one install's entire document library behind a `notes/` directory,
  because a probe asking "does this folder have content?" changes its
  answer the moment someone puts content there.

  **The doc library offers the conversion**, on web and on mobile, to
  any vault that still nests projects. A migration that ships only as a
  CLI command is one that only the people who wrote it ever run. Every
  existing vault would have stayed nested with its owner never learning
  there was a choice. The offer is dismissible and never appears for a
  vault that is already flat or has nothing to move, and the gateway
  says the same thing once in the startup log for anyone who never
  opens the UI.

  Nothing moves without a preview. Web and mobile both run the
  migration as a dry run and show the real list, including what it
  refuses to touch and why, before anything is renamed.
  `opendray notes flatten` does the same from a terminal. It defaults
  to a dry run, drives the same rename the UI uses so `[[wiki links]]`
  are repointed as it goes, repoints per-cwd project overrides, and
  **never overwrites**: a destination that already exists is reported
  and skipped, leaving both copies for you to reconcile.

  Where a project's notes live is now answered by the gateway,
  `/notes/info` reports the layout and the project mapping carries
  `personal_path`, instead of being re-derived by web, mobile and the
  CLI. Three implementations guessing is three chances to disagree, and
  the CLI's `notes project` was already guessing wrong.

  Reserved names step aside rather than collide: a project called
  `daily` files under `daily-docs`, since `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` belongs
  to the whole vault. `_`- and `.`-prefixed names are reserved too.

  The conversion records the resulting layout itself and applies it to
  the running gateway, rather than leaving both to the next restart.
  Otherwise a converted vault keeps deriving `projects/<name>` and
  `personal/<name>.md` against the directories it just emptied. The
  directories the migration empties are removed; one still holding
  anything is left exactly where it is.

- **Documents save when you say so, not on a timer.** The editor wrote
  after every pause in typing, so a long document rewrote itself to
  disk over and over while it was being worked on. Saving is now a
  button, or ⌘S / Ctrl+S, on web and on mobile. Leaving a document
  still flushes unsaved text, that safety net costs nothing while
  typing, and closing the browser tab with unsaved work asks first.

  Autosave was not the whole story behind the typing lag, so two things
  that were: the editor streamed **every keystroke** to the page, which
  re-rendered the whole vault tree and recomputed the outline per
  character; and the tree re-rendered along with it. The stream is now
  paced to what a sidebar can use, and the tree only re-renders when
  the note list or the selection changes.

- **Line numbers in the source view.** On by default for HTML, off for
  markdown, and toggleable either way. Numbers turn wrapping off, the
  way every code editor does it: a wrapped line covers several rows, so
  a gutter counting 1..N drifts on exactly the long lines an HTML
  document is full of.

- **The doc library can rename and delete a document.** It could create
  and edit one, and that was all. A daily note, or anything not bound
  to a project, could be made but never moved or removed from the one
  surface that lists everything. Rename goes through the move endpoint,
  so the `[[wiki links]]` pointing at the old path are repointed rather
  than left dangling, and a partial rewrite is reported instead of
  being folded into a plain "renamed". Mobile gains rename too; it
  already had delete.

- **"New" and "Today" are reachable once a document is open.** They
  were in the header the whole time, pushed off the right edge by the
  vault path: a `truncate` element in a flex row still needs
  `min-width: 0`, or it refuses to shrink below its content. Anyone
  with a long vault path could only reach the two actions from the
  empty state, which is exactly when they had no documents to leave.

- **A folder holding the selected document can be collapsed again.**
  The tree re-applied "open the ancestors of the selection" on every
  render, so the collapse landed and the next render undid it, and
  "Collapse all" left that one branch open. Revealing the selection is
  a response to the selection changing, not a rule about what must stay
  open, so it now runs once per selection.

- **`opendray notes` accepts flags after the subcommand.** Go's `flag`
  package stops parsing at the first non-flag argument, so `notes
  flatten --apply` left `apply` false, performed a dry run, and advised
  re-running with `--apply`, which is what had just been typed.
  `notes list --prefix=x` silently listed everything for the same
  reason. Both orders now mean the same thing.

- **The Vault is your documents. Agent skills and the MCP registry moved
  out.** One root held three tenants with nothing in common: the
  operator's markdown, the skills opendray injects at spawn, and the MCP
  registry, which is why the settings page could only describe it as
  "notes, skills and git-versioned root", a sentence that parses only if
  you already know the implementation. Opening the Vault showed
  `skills/` and `mcp/` sitting among your folders, and because Vault
  Sync commits that same directory, they went to your remote: on one
  install a private docs repo had picked up opendray's own
  `skills/secretary/SKILL.md`, and a `git clean -fd` there would have
  deleted the gateway's skills.

  New installs get `~/.opendray/vault` for documents, `~/.opendray/
  skills` and `~/.opendray/mcp` beside it, and a Vault repo holding
  writing and nothing else. **Existing installs are not moved**: any
  root with content still in the old place keeps being used, the
  settings page prints where everything actually resolved, and says
  plainly when it is still the shared layout. `vault.notes` and
  `vault.skills` keep working; `vault.root` now means the documents
  directory, and `[skills].root` is the new spelling. Machinery
  directories that do sit inside the Vault are hidden from the doc
  library and added to an opendray-managed `.gitignore` block, so
  nothing new gets carried to your remote. Anything already committed
  needs `git rm --cached`. opendray will not rewrite your repo.

  Path resolution used to be reimplemented in four places (the gateway
  plus each of `opendray notes|skill|mcp`) with different precedence in
  each, so the CLI could read a different directory than the running
  gateway. There is now exactly one resolver.

### Fixed

- **Verifying a git credential now checks that it can *push*, not just
  read.** A GitHub fine-grained token's Contents permission has three
  levels: No access, Read-only, Read and write, and every check the
  verification made passed identically for a Read-only one. So it went
  green, the Vault pulled happily, and the first push came back
  `remote: Write access to repository not granted ... 403`, the same
  message a token with *no* Contents produces on a plain fetch, which
  sends you looking at everything except the token.

  Verification now also probes git's receive-pack advertisement:
  literally the first request `git push` makes, asked with the same
  credential over the same protocol, and a plain GET that changes
  nothing. If it is refused, push will be refused. Because it is git's
  wire protocol rather than a forge API, one probe covers GitHub, Gitea
  and GitLab, and it cannot disagree with what git actually does. A
  read-only credential now reports "CANNOT push (read-only)" and names
  the setting to change. A forge answer that is neither a clear yes nor
  a clear no is reported as nothing at all. Telling someone their
  working token is read-only is the same mistake pointed the other way.

- **"Reset to remote" no longer silently destroys unpushed work.** It
  ran `git reset --hard` plus `git clean -fd` behind a confirmation
  that named no quantity, survivable when the remote is ahead of you,
  and not survivable when the remote is *empty*. A vault whose pushes
  have all been failing is exactly that, and the two faults compose:
  one operator lost 354 documents when a read-only token made every
  push 403, the local commits piled up unpushed, a pull hit a rebase
  conflict, and "reset to remote" looked like the way out of the
  conflict.

  The endpoint now counts what exists only locally (unpushed commits,
  modified files, untracked files) and refuses with a 409 and that
  breakdown unless the caller explicitly confirms. The dialog quotes
  the numbers and names example files instead of asking "are you
  sure?". And confirming is no longer final: opendray parks the
  unpushed commits on an `opendray-rescue/<timestamp>` branch and
  stashes the working tree (`--include-untracked`, since `clean -fd`
  is what destroys untracked files and no ref can hold those) before
  resetting, then names the rescue branch in the success toast. A tree
  that is already level with its remote loses nothing and still resets
  in one click. A confirmation that fires on no-ops is one people
  learn to dismiss.

### Added

- **Git credentials are scoped per host *and owner*, so one forge can
  hold several identities.** One row per hostname assumed one identity
  per forge, which breaks the moment you touch a personal repo and an
  org repo on the same host: a fine-grained GitHub token is granted per
  repository, so the token that reaches `github.com/<you>/…` generally
  cannot reach `github.com/<org>/…`, and there was nowhere to put the
  second one. Git host entries now take an optional **Owner**;
  resolution prefers the owner-scoped credential and falls back to the
  host-wide one, so existing setups keep working untouched. Vault sync
  resolves the same way, which it previously could not: it only ever
  looked up by hostname, and its auth panel now names the credential it
  resolved to, saying plainly when the remote's owner has none of its
  own and the host-wide one is standing in.

- **Git hosts is now the authority for HTTPS git auth.** A session's
  push went out with whatever the machine offered. Xcode ships
  `credential.helper = osxkeychain` enabled, so a stale keychain entry
  answered silently and failed with an error describing a token nobody
  remembered configuring. Pushes now authenticate with the configured
  credential, and inherited helpers are blanked for HTTPS remotes **even
  when opendray has nothing registered**: failing as "no credentials"
  beats quietly succeeding as an identity you never chose. SSH remotes
  are untouched: the agent is a deliberate, visible configuration.

- **Disabling a git host entry now actually disables it.** The toggle
  changed nothing: credential resolution returned disabled rows and every
  caller (vault sync, PR and issue listing, remote detection) used the
  token regardless, so an entry switched off kept authenticating. The
  check now lives in the resolver, which also makes disabling compose
  properly: turn off an owner-scoped entry and its host falls back to the
  host-wide one, exactly as if the row were absent.

- **Git host entries can be verified against the forge.** A stored token
  was a claim nobody checked, and the forges hide the mistake: a GitHub
  fine-grained token keeps "which repositories" and "which permissions"
  in separate sections of one form, with permissions defaulting to
  none, so granting all repositories and stopping there produces a
  token that authenticates perfectly and cannot read a single repo. Git
  then reports `Write access to repository not granted` on a plain
  fetch, naming the wrong permission on the wrong operation. **Verify**
  now asks the forge who the token belongs to, warns when that differs
  from the entry's owner, and optionally checks a specific repo, with a
  hint that says where to look.

### Added

- **Markdown in the Vault is syntax-highlighted while you edit it.** The
  file viewer has always coloured what it shows, so raw markdown in the
  Vault (the one place people actually read and write it) was the last
  flat grey surface. Web layers a highlighted backdrop under the
  textarea; mobile colours the field directly through its editing
  controller, so the caret can't drift from the glyphs. Headings, bold,
  italic, code, links, quotes, lists, tags and `[[wiki-links]]`.

### Fixed

- **The Vault no longer describes itself as an Obsidian feature.** It
  syncs through a plain git remote. Obsidian is merely one editor that
  can be pointed at the same repo, not something opendray integrates
  with. The user-facing wording was corrected in the previous release;
  this clears the same claim from the code that outlives it.

### Added

- **New docs start from a template, and folders can explain themselves.**
  Every doc previously started as an empty file with a heading, which is
  how a vault ends up with five different ideas of what a feature note
  is. Creating a doc now offers **Blank / Feature / Decision (ADR) /
  Runbook**, and a folder holding a `README.md` gets a control that opens
  it, so a directory can say what lives in it. Templates render
  server-side (the title comes from the filename, the date from the
  clock) so a doc started on the phone and one started on the web come
  out identical rather than drifting. Dropping `_templates/<id>.md` in
  the vault overrides a built-in or adds a new one, so a project can
  change the shape of its docs without a gateway release.

### Added

- **The Vault can hold a folder structure you actually maintain.** Project
  docs were a flat list: the "New doc" box replaced `/` with `-`, so
  `features/canvas.md` became `features-canvas.md` and a folder could not
  be created from the UI at all, while the backend had stored nested
  paths the whole time and the Notes page already rendered them as a tree.
  The project-docs lane now renders that tree (rooted at the project, with
  a Recent toggle for "the one I just edited"), typing a path with slashes
  files a doc in a folder, and a new **move/rename** repoints the
  `[[wiki-links]]` that pointed at the old path. Without that, filing a
  doc away silently stranded every reference to it, which is why nobody
  reorganised. Web and mobile both; the rewrite skips code blocks, so a
  fenced example of the syntax is never edited.

## [v2.13.1], 2026-08-07

Your phone and your browser can reach the gateway again while its Mac
sits idle. A machine that falls asleep takes its network with it, so the
gateway simply stops answering, a failure that looks exactly like a
flaky gateway from every surface that talks to it, and sends people
reading gateway code instead of `pmset -g log`. opendray now holds the
host awake while it serves, and lets you choose how far to take that.

### Added

- **Host power is now a setting you can see, on web and mobile.** The
  choice between "stay reachable" and "let the machine sleep" was only
  reachable by hand-editing `config.toml`, which meant nobody found it.
  Server settings gain a **Host power** section listing all four modes
  with what each one costs (web renders them as annotated cards, mobile
  as a labelled picker) plus a note that a deliberate sleep is never
  blocked and that non-macOS hosts ignore the setting. Translated across
  English, 中文 and Español.

- **Wake-on-demand: the host may sleep, and phone/web traffic wakes it.**
  `[host] prevent_idle_sleep = "on_demand"` lets the gateway's Mac sleep
  whenever things are quiet instead of being held awake around the clock.
  Incoming traffic dark-wakes the machine (macOS "Wake for network
  access"); the gateway then seizes a power assertion the moment a
  request, live stream or mid-turn session shows up, extends the wake for
  as long as serving actually takes, and lets go after a two-minute
  linger so the host can sleep again. Running sessions count as activity,
  so a turn started from a phone survives the phone locking. On-demand
  warns at startup if `womp` is disabled, since without it a sleeping
  host can't be woken remotely at all. The existing `"ac"` (default),
  `"always"` and `"off"` behaviours are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Saving invalid server settings no longer bricks the next restart.**
  `PUT /admin/settings` wrote whatever it was given. Since the loader
  validates on every startup, a bad value (an unparseable duration, an
  unknown mode) saved cleanly and then stopped the gateway from coming
  back up, with nothing naming the offending field. The write path now
  validates exactly what is about to hit disk and answers 400 instead,
  leaving the stored config untouched.

- **The gateway keeps its host awake, so phone and web stay connected.**
  A Mac left to itself idle-sleeps, and a sleeping host takes its network
  with it: the gateway stops answering, a remote Postgres becomes
  unreachable, and every phone or web request times out until someone
  physically wakes the machine. Incoming traffic does dark-wake the host,
  but the window is short and a user-session LaunchAgent isn't reliably
  scheduled inside it, so the request has already timed out, which reads
  as "opendray is flaky" and sends people reading gateway code instead of
  `pmset -g log`. opendray now holds a power assertion for as long as it
  serves. Default is wall-power only, so a laptop on battery still sleeps
  normally; `[host] prevent_idle_sleep` takes `"always"` or `"off"`. A
  deliberate sleep (lid close, Apple menu → Sleep) is never blocked, and
  the assertion is tied to the gateway's pid so even a SIGKILL can't
  strand the host awake. macOS only; accepted and ignored elsewhere.

## [v2.13.0], 2026-08-07

The Canvas: the agent renders a page you can actually see, mark up and
iterate on, instead of describing a screen in prose and hoping it matches.

### Added

- **Canvas: a visual surface for designing with the agent.** The agent
  renders a self-contained HTML page via `canvas_render` and it appears in
  the operator's panel, where they pin a point or drag a region and send
  those marks back as feedback. Marking reports the real element selector
  and markup (and for a region, the components inside the frame) so the
  agent iterates on the DOM instead of guessing from coordinates. Not only
  UI mocks: `ui`, `flow` (flowchart), `mindmap`, `graph` (relationship
  diagram) and `doc` (a formatted spec page), with diagrams authored as
  inline SVG so they need no external assets and stay markable node by node.
- **A focused canvas per project.** A project accumulates many canvases, so
  one is FOCUSED per cwd, scoped to the project rather than the session
  because the MCP server only ever receives the cwd. Browsing the list is
  free and costs nothing; only an explicit "Work on this" seeds the note
  that makes ordinary conversation ("make the title bigger") resolve to that
  canvas. Agents pull the same fact with `canvas_context`, and a slug-less
  `canvas_render` targets the focused canvas rather than creating a
  duplicate.
- **A design system per project.** Colour / type / radius / spacing tokens
  plus free-text style rules, carried in every canvas request AND injected
  into each rendered document as CSS variables. The pairing is what stops
  successive renders from drifting apart. Ships starting palettes for people
  who don't think in hex, a real colour picker, and two one-click jobs: read
  the project's actual theme, or draw the system as a canvas.
- **Full mobile parity** for all of the above: viewer, viewport switching,
  focus and precise marking from the phone.
- **`opendray status` is now a systemctl-style health dashboard.** On macOS
  the command used to dump ~80 lines of raw `launchctl print` internals.
  A live process says nothing about whether the gateway is serving HTTP or
  can reach its database. The default output is now a compact checklist:
  process, HTTP health + uptime, database reachability, listen address,
  restart count (with the last non-zero exit surfaced as a hint) and the
  config path. The raw launchd/systemd dump moved behind `--raw`.

### Changed

- **`primary` in a design system means the BRAND colour, and the gateway
  now says so.** shadcn/ui and the Tailwind templates built on it use
  `--primary` for a near-black or near-white ink and keep the brand hue in
  `--accent`, so an agent mapping token names one-to-one produced a palette
  of greys with no brand colour in it. The contract is now stated wherever
  an agent reads it (the extract prompt, the `canvas_design` tool schema,
  the token docs and the catalog guidance) and saving a palette whose every
  colour resolves to a grey returns an advisory warning saying what probably
  went wrong.

### Fixed

- **Design-system swatches show the real colour, in any notation.** Reading
  a colour back from `getComputedStyle().color` only yields `rgb(…)` for
  legacy sRGB notations (a modern colour function round-trips unchanged in
  both WebKit and Chromium) so an all-oklch project got a grid of identical
  grey fallbacks on the web, and mobile, which parsed nothing but `#rrggbb`,
  got no swatches at all. The gateway now resolves hex / rgb / hsl / oklch /
  oklab centrally and serves the result, which also lets the hex-only OS
  colour picker edit an oklch theme without converting it one field at a
  time.
- **Pin and region marks stay on the content they were placed on.** The web
  panel recorded a mark as a percentage of the visible frame and drew it in
  an overlay on top of the preview, so it was anchored to the window: scroll
  the canvas and the mark stayed put while the content moved out from under
  it, and a mark made after scrolling was stored pointing somewhere else
  entirely. Marks are now recorded in document percentages and drawn into the
  canvas document itself. This also settles a mismatch where the same `x`/`y`
  field meant frame percentages from the web and document percentages from
  mobile.
- **The mouse wheel (and touch swipe) now scrolls grok and opencode
  sessions.** These TUIs enable mouse tracking (so xterm hands them the
  wheel instead of scrolling its own viewport) but then ignore wheel events,
  scrolling only on arrow keys. opendray's wheel→arrow fallback was gated
  behind "app hasn't grabbed the mouse", so it never ran for them and the
  wheel did nothing (verified live: grok sets `?1000/1002/1003/1006` at
  startup yet does nothing on button-64/65). The web terminal now recognises
  these wheel-ignoring providers and sends arrow keys for both wheel and
  one-finger touch scroll, scoped by `providerId` so Claude/Codex/Antigravity
  (which genuinely consume the wheel) are untouched.
- **Coming back to the mobile app after it slept no longer fails session
  loads.** While the app is suspended the OS silently tears down its TCP
  connections, but the HTTP client's pool didn't know. The next request
  went out on a dead socket and stalled into a 30-second timeout and a
  full-screen error, even on a LAN. Connection-level failures on GET/HEAD
  are now replayed up to twice with backoff (a 4xx/5xx still passes
  through untouched), the pool's idle timeout drops to 5 seconds so stale
  sockets are rarely handed out at all, and returning from a suspension of
  5+ seconds refetches the session list immediately instead of waiting for
  the next tap.

### Security

- **Hardened the path-containment barrier behind `/fs/download`, `/fs/zip`
  and `/fs/upload`.** The root-scoped filesystem endpoints now validate the
  resolved path with `filepath.IsLocal` and refuse any residual `..`
  sequence in the canonical path (which also means oddly-named entries like
  `notes..md` are rejected inside these endpoints). Resolves all seven open
  CodeQL `go/path-injection` alerts plus one allocation-size-overflow
  finding.
- **Bumped vulnerable transitive npm dependencies** in the web workspace
  lockfile: seroval 1.6.2 (critical GHSA-mv8w-475r-vwqw), brace-expansion
  5.0.9 (three DoS advisories), postcss 8.5.26 (path-traversal advisories)
  and `@babel/core` 7.29.7. Lockfile-only; no manifest changes.

## [v2.12.2], 2026-07-23

Round Table members gain live, grounded memory, the mobile session screen
is rebuilt around a tool dock, and the operator takes ownership of the four
global knowledge pages so their curation finally sticks.

### Added

- **Round Table members read the shared memory.** Every seated provider now
  gets live, **read-only** access to the shared `opendray-memory` MCP, so
  members ground their claims in the real store instead of guessing. A new
  read-only mode (`OPENDRAY_MEMORY_READONLY=1`) exposes only the search / read
  tools and refuses every write server-side (safe even with tool permissions
  open) and the table prompt flips to "ground your claims via these tools".
  A single per-provider attach point (`catalog.AttachMemoryMCP`) handles the
  antigravity / codex quirks and is reusable for any spawn.
- **Operator owns the form of the four global KB pages.** The shape of
  `kb_infrastructure` / `kb_conventions` / `kb_lessons` / `kb_reusable` was
  hardcoded in the drafter's prompts, so every consolidation sweep
  re-manufactured the fixed fat skeleton and operator curation never stuck.
  The drafter now honours each page's blueprint `maintainer_mode` (`human` →
  the operator owns it outright, never drafted) and, for AI-maintained pages,
  edits the operator's current structure **in place** (folding in only new,
  on-topic evidence) instead of regenerating from a template. A per-page
  `prompt_hint` lets the operator steer form and scope without a code change.
  Set both via `PUT /blueprint/{slug}` (cwd `__global__`); a web/mobile toggle
  is a follow-up. No migration. The four pages default to the previous
  behaviour.
- **Mobile: session tool dock.** The session detail screen is rebuilt so the
  terminal owns the full height under a two-line AppBar title, and a new
  **SessionToolDock** (Files · Git · Database · Vault · More) opens each tool
  as a bottom sheet over the live terminal. The overflow ⋮ menu is slimmed to
  session actions.

### Changed

- **Mobile: More / settings redesigned.** The flat menu is rebuilt as grouped
  inset cards per section, with an account-block identity header (monogram
  avatar), accent-tinted icon chips, refined typography and a version footer.
  New `sessions.dock.more` / `sessions.tools.*` strings ship across en / zh /
  es at 100% parity.

### Fixed

- **A human-locked global KB page could never converge from the UI.** Two bugs
  are fixed: approving a divergence proposal silently dropped the lock (the
  merge was written as `updated_by='agent'`, flipping `HumanLocked` off). An
  approval is an operator decision, so the result now stays operator-authored
  and locked; and rejecting a proposal didn't stick: the drafter re-generated
  and re-filed the identical refresh every consolidation cycle. The drafter now
  skips a locked page whose feedstock signature matches an already-rejected
  proposal, so a rejection holds instead of nagging forever.

### Docs

- The README surfaces the two marquee capabilities shipped since the last pass:
  **Round Table** (cross-vendor AI group chat + role-assigned execution
  plans) and the **Database tool** (Postgres / MySQL / MariaDB / SQLite,
  per-project crypto isolation, web + mobile), plus staged image attachments,
  TUI theme-following / wheel-scroll, and one-click provider updates.

## [v2.12.1], 2026-07-18

Grok reaches parity with the other cloud agents, the Cortex knowledge base
grows a real management surface, and the mobile knowledge experience is
rebuilt for phones.

### Added

- **Grok is now a first-class cloud agent.** It can drive the shared memory
  MCP (memory search, `doc_read`, cross-layer recall) just like Claude / Codex
  / Antigravity. Its spawn folder is marked trusted so grok actually starts
  the injected memory server instead of silently skipping it. Grok and OpenCode
  are also selectable in **Discuss with AI** and as **Memory Worker** agent
  providers, and creating a grok session now offers the **Bypass permissions /
  YOLO** toggle (`--always-approve`) the other agents already had.
- **A cross-page KB Librarian (experimental).** Launch a dedicated agent
  session (pick its cloud agent, model and account) that can organize,
  create, edit and delete **any** global knowledge page across the whole base,
  driven conversationally, unlike the per-page Discuss chat. It gets read +
  write KB tools (list / upsert config / write body / delete) on its memory
  MCP; those tools are scoped to the Librarian session alone and never reach
  ordinary or third-party sessions.
- **Edit a knowledge page's settings after creation.** A `kb_*` page's title,
  one-line description, nature (foundational / emergent) and *inject* flag were
  locked in at creation; they are now editable in place (web + mobile) on every
  page except the classic four, including seeded pages like Integrations, so
  you can flip a page between full-inject and on-demand retrieval.
- **Discuss with AI model lists are live and accurate.** Antigravity and
  OpenCode models are enumerated straight from their CLIs, and Codex offers its
  full model family (higher plans unlock the fuller models) instead of one
  pinned choice, no more picking a stale model that fails at spawn.
- **Round Table members can change mid-conversation.** Add or remove seated
  providers on an active chat (web + mobile): an added member is `@mentionable`
  on the next turn with the full thread as context; a removed one stops
  replying while its past messages stay.
- **Mobile: staged image uploads.** Images queue in a dismissable tray before
  send instead of uploading immediately.

### Changed

- **The mobile Knowledge (KB) page is rebuilt as a searchable list → detail
  flow.** The old horizontal page-chip strip didn't scale once you had many
  `kb_*` docs; the KB tab is now a grouped, searchable list (Foundational /
  Emergent) that grows gracefully, and tapping a page opens a full-screen
  reader/editor with its actions in an AppBar overflow menu. New page and the
  Librarian move onto a FAB.

### Fixed

- **Grok sessions had no MCP / memory tools.** opendray wrote the memory server
  into the project-scoped `<cwd>/.grok/config.toml`, but grok refuses to start
  repo-local MCP servers in an untrusted folder as a supply-chain guard, so the
  server was configured but never started. opendray now trusts the operator's
  own spawn folder (`--trust`), matching the other CLIs.
- **The web terminal input cursor no longer drifts on iPad.**

## [v2.12.0], 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Round Table: a cross-vendor AI group chat (experimental).** Seat several
  providers (Claude / Codex / Antigravity / Grok / OpenCode) plus the operator
  in one shared thread; @mention who should reply (or `@all`) and each member
  answers in character after reading the whole conversation, so heterogeneous
  foundation-model families react to each other in seat order. Summarize the
  discussion on demand, or turn it into a **role-assigned execution plan**:
  each step runs as a real session in a shared project (bind the project after
  the fact if you started without one). **Hand the whole thread off** to a
  working session to do the actual code changes. A chat can be **closed and
  reopened** (close keeps the thread, just stops new messages). Available on
  both the web admin and the mobile app, where Round Table gets its own
  bottom-nav tab, per-agent bubble colours, and labelled action menus.
  Fully self-contained and rollback-able (`internal/roundtable/ROLLBACK.md`).

### Fixed

- **The Files-tree download icon is now reachable on touch devices (iPad,
  phones).** The per-row download button was revealed only on hover
  (`group-hover`) or keyboard focus. Tailwind v4 gates `group-hover` behind
  `@media (hover: hover)`, so on a touch device (which can neither hover nor
  focus a row) the icon stayed at `opacity-0` and was impossible to tap. It
  now pins visible under `@media (hover: none)`, so touch users get a
  permanently-shown download control while pointer users keep the clean
  hover-reveal. (Follow-up to the v2.11.6 positioning fix, which addressed
  *where* the icon sits but not *whether* it ever appears without a mouse.)
- **Two MCP servers sharing a display name no longer brick Codex sessions.**
  Every provider renderer keys its generated config on a server's display
  name, not its unique id. Two enabled servers with the same name therefore
  collided on that key: Codex emitted a duplicate `[mcp_servers."…"]` TOML
  table and died with `duplicate key` at startup (before printing a byte, so
  the session flipped straight to the read-only "[buffer unavailable]" view)
  while Claude's map-based renderer silently dropped one of them. `renderMCP`
  now rejects a duplicate name up front (for every provider, before any config
  file is written), and the Plugins create/update endpoints return `409` when
  a new or edited server would reuse a name already taken by a different id.
  Grok's manifest gap and this collision are unrelated; a stray second Notion
  entry sharing the name `Notion API` is what exposed it.
- **Grok now reports and applies CLI updates from the Providers page.** The
  `grok` manifest carried an empty `npmPackage`, and the whole update path is
  npm-gated: `CheckUpdate` returned early (no latest version, no
  "update available" flag) and `Update` hard-errored with "not updatable via
  npm". Grok is published as `@xai-official/grok` (maintainer
  `xai-security@x.ai`), so the manifest now names it.
- **A provider CLI installed outside npm can now be updated in place.** Grok's
  documented installer (`curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash`) drops
  a symlink into the npm bin dir that npm does not own, and npm refuses to
  clobber it: `EEXIST: file already exists`. Simply naming the package would
  therefore have shipped a dashboard that advertises an update behind a button
  that always fails. `Update` now preflights the bin path: an unmanaged
  **symlink** is cleared so npm can take ownership (and the update output tells
  the operator exactly which link was replaced), while a regular **file** is
  never deleted: it is reported instead, mirroring the existing
  `ErrUpdatePrefixReadonly` preflight. Grok's install note now recommends
  `npm install -g @xai-official/grok`.

## [v2.11.6], 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **The download icon is reachable again in a deep or long file tree.** The
  session inspector's Files tree renders inside a scroll area whose inner
  wrapper sizes to its content, so long filenames and deep nesting pushed
  rows wider than the panel: names were hard-cut with no ellipsis, and the
  hover-download icon (anchored to each row's right edge) sat beyond the
  visible edge, so hovering a file appeared to do nothing. The tree is now
  constrained to the panel width, so names truncate with an ellipsis and the
  download icon sits at the visible right edge. The Database tab is
  unaffected (its grid scrolls in its own containers). (#443)

## [v2.11.5], 2026-07-13

### Added

- **TUIs follow the opendray theme.** A terminal UI picks a light/dark
  palette by asking the terminal, via the OSC 11 background query (which
  xterm.js already answered) or the `COLORFGBG` environment variable, which
  opendray never set. So a CLI that reads the environment (Grok's
  `theme = "auto"`, vim, tmux, …) had no way to know the operator was in
  light mode and always defaulted to dark. opendray now stamps the client's
  applied theme on session create and advertises it at spawn via
  `COLORFGBG`. Optional and backward-compatible: no theme advertises
  nothing and the CLI keeps its own default, and an explicit `COLORFGBG`
  already in the environment still wins. (#446)
- **The mouse wheel scrolls full-screen TUIs.** In the alternate screen
  there is no xterm scrollback, and a CLI that hasn't grabbed the mouse
  never receives wheel events either, so the wheel silently did nothing
  and a Grok conversation couldn't be scrolled at all. opendray now does
  what a real terminal does (alternate-scroll): wheel notches become cursor
  Up/Down keys when the app is in the alternate screen and hasn't grabbed
  the mouse. CLIs that do grab the mouse (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity)
  are unaffected. They already receive the wheel as SGR events. (#446)
- **Custom tasks are pre-scoped to the current project.** (#442)

### Fixed

- **A disconnected browser no longer wedges CLI updates.** Provider updates
  ran `npm install -g` on the HTTP *request* context, so a client
  disconnect (browser closed, proxy timeout) cancelled it and SIGKILLed npm
  mid-install. A half-killed npm leaves a partial global tree behind (a
  stale `.<pkg>-XXXXXX` temp dir) after which *every* later install fails
  with `ENOTEMPTY`, permanently wedging updates for that CLI (a codex update
  stayed broken for a week this way, and left a CLI whose platform binary
  never landed, so its sessions failed too). The install is now detached
  from the caller's cancellation. (#445)
- **A broken CLI is now visible instead of looking healthy.** When a
  provider's binary is on `PATH` but won't run, opendray used to fall back
  to showing the manifest version, rendering a CLI that can't even launch
  as perfectly fine. It now reports "Installed but not runnable" with the
  CLI's own error, and a failed update surfaces npm's actual message
  (`ENOTEMPTY: …`) rather than a bare `exit status 217`. (#445)

## [v2.11.4], 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Mobile: Resources section + Updates "what's new" sheet.** The mobile
  app gains the sidebar Resources block and the Updates/"what's new" sheet,
  reaching parity with the web admin (#433). (#439)

### Fixed

- **Antigravity spawns no longer fail on an empty MCP config.** antigravity's
  first-run migration writes an empty `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`;
  opendray's MCP-injection prep parsed it unconditionally and errored with
  *"provider prepare: parse …/mcp_config.json … unexpected end of JSON
  input"*, blocking every Antigravity session spawn. An empty (or
  whitespace-only) file is now treated as "no config yet" rather than a parse
  error, on both the `mcp_config.json` and gemini `settings.json` surfaces. (#440)
- **Grok provider icon.** Grok is now registered in the web provider
  icon/visual lookup tables so its brand mark renders. (#434)

## [v2.11.3], 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Session terminal: staged image attachments.** Uploading an image to a
  session (attach button, clipboard paste, or drag-and-drop) now stages it
  as a dismissable chip in a tray at the bottom of the terminal instead of
  typing the server path straight into the running CLI. **Esc** (or the
  chip's ✕) cancels it (an empty tray still passes Esc through to the CLI)
  and an **Insert** button commits the path(s) when you're ready. Fixes the
  long-standing "the uploaded path can't be dismissed" surprise. Web for
  now; mobile parity to follow. (#436)
- **Sidebar Resources block + Updates drawer.** The web admin's left nav
  gains a Resources section under Settings: an **Updates** drawer that shows
  "what's new" from GitHub Releases (falling back to CHANGELOG.md) with an
  unread badge and "mark read", plus **Docs**, **Community**, and
  **Sponsor** links. (#433)

## [v2.11.2], 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Database tool: MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite.** The Database tool now
  connects to MySQL and MariaDB (host/port/username like PostgreSQL; a
  MySQL "schema" is a database) and SQLite in addition to PostgreSQL. The
  connection form (web and mobile) gains an engine picker with per-engine
  default ports. **SQLite is a file-path connection**: the path is fenced
  to the connection's project `cwd` (a path escaping it via `../` or a
  symlink is rejected) and extension loading is disabled. Reads run behind
  the same read-only fence on every engine (SQLite via a dedicated
  read-only connection pool). All engines are pure-Go drivers
  (`go-sql-driver/mysql`, `modernc.org/sqlite`), so the binary still
  cross-compiles without cgo. Migration `0075` widens the driver
  constraint; `0076` reseeds the kb_integrations page.

### Fixed

- **Backup download link authorises correctly.** The backup download URL
  now carries the admin token, so downloading a backup from the web UI no
  longer fails auth. (#428)

## [v2.11.1], 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Mobile parity: Database tool in the session inspector.** The mobile
  app's session inspector gains a Database tab mirroring the web tool:
  browse schemas and tables, page through rows, insert / update / delete
  by primary key, and run read or write SQL against the project's
  registered connections, honouring `db:read` / `db:write` scopes and
  read-only connections, and reusing the session's `cwd` for isolation.
- **Mobile parity: upload files into a session.** The mobile session
  inspector's Files tab gains an upload button: pick one or more files and
  stream them into the current directory via `POST /api/v1/fs/upload`,
  matching the web files-sidebar upload shipped in v2.11.0 (same
  `resolveWithinRoot` sandbox, auto-rename on name collision).

### Security

- **Database tool: cryptographic per-project isolation for the
  auto-attached MCP.** The `opendray-dbtool` MCP now holds a `db:signed`
  key and sends a per-session `X-OpenDray-Dbtool-Sig = HMAC(secret, cwd)`
  header; the gateway rejects a signed-key call whose signature doesn't
  match the `cwd`. An agent that extracts the injected key can no longer
  forge another project's `cwd`, closing the residual the honest-path
  check left open. Antigravity (whose MCP config is HOME-global and can't
  carry a per-session signature, a Google limitation) and third-party
  integration keys keep the plain `?cwd=` check via a separate honest-path
  key. Migration `0074` reseeds the kb_integrations page.

### Fixed

- **Database tool: bigint primary keys stay exact.** Row update/delete
  and filters decode JSON with `UseNumber`, so a 64-bit primary key above
  2^53 is no longer rounded through `float64` (which could address the
  wrong row or match none). Numbers beyond int64 keep their exact string.
- **Database tool: consistent table metadata.** `TableMeta` runs its four
  catalog queries (columns / PK / indexes / FKs) inside one read-only
  transaction, so concurrent DDL can't produce a half-updated view.

### Changed

- **Dependencies.** Bump `golang.org/x/crypto` 0.50.0 → 0.52.0 (#421) and
  `golang.org/x/net` 0.52.0 → 0.55.0 (#418), pulling transitive `x/sys`
  and `x/text` updates. Build and vet clean.

## [v2.11.0], 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Upload files & folders into a session from the files sidebar.** The
  session inspector's files panel can now create folders and upload files
  or whole folders (recursively, preserving the subtree) via an upload
  button or drag-and-drop, including dropping onto a specific folder row
  to target it, or the panel background to target the session cwd.
  Uploads land in the session's working directory where the AI model reads
  them, streamed to disk (250 MiB per file) and confined to the session
  cwd by the same `resolveWithinRoot` sandbox the download/zip endpoints
  use. Path traversal and symlinked-intermediate escapes are rejected.
  Conflicting names auto-rename (`name-1.ext`) instead of overwriting what
  the session produced. New admin-only endpoint `POST /api/v1/fs/upload`
  on the existing `/fs` group; the tree refreshes to show new files
  (including renames). (#420)
- **Database tool: direct project database access.** opendray can now
  hold per-project (cwd-keyed) database connections and expose them like a
  JetBrains-style database tool: browse schemas/tables, read table data,
  edit rows, and run a SQL console. It surfaces two ways: a **Database
  tab** on each project screen (web: connection manager, lazy schema tree,
  paginated data grid with row insert/edit/delete, and a CodeMirror SQL
  console with schema-aware autocompletion; mobile: connection management,
  schema browse, read-only query) and an auto-attached **`opendray-dbtool`
  MCP server** (`db_connections_list` / `db_schema` / `db_table_data` /
  `db_query` / `db_execute`) so agent sessions can query and mutate a
  project's database directly. PostgreSQL only for now (a driver interface
  reserves MySQL/SQLite). Connection passwords are encrypted at rest with
  the same field cipher as channel/git-host secrets and are never returned
  by any read endpoint. Two new scopes, `db:read` (browse + read-only
  SQL) and `db:write` (row CRUD + write/DDL), gate integration access;
  **registering a connection stays admin-only** (an integration can never
  point opendray at a new host). Reads run inside a server-side `READ ONLY`
  transaction with a statement timeout, and per-connection `read_only`
  refuses every write regardless of scope. The dbtool MCP is withheld from
  `origin=integration` sessions, matching memory isolation. Configurable
  via `[dbtool]` (enabled by default; the feature is inert until a
  connection is registered). Migrations `0072` (schema) and `0073`
  (kb_integrations reseed).
- **Mobile: antigravity multi-account parity with web.** The mobile app
  gains the antigravity multi-account management already shipped on web
  (#396). (#409)
- **Mobile: Grok provider brand mark**, syncing the real Grok icon added
  to web in #405. (#408)
- **Memory search surfaces folded (deduped) variants** in `memory_search`
  and `memory_load_context`, so callers see the merged form rather than
  near-duplicate rows. (#414)

### Fixed

- **antigravity MCP injection now targets the real config surface**, so
  injected servers actually reach antigravity sessions. (#416)
- **Transcript overlay for CLIs with unscrollable TUIs**: the web
  terminal can surface scrollback for tools whose full-screen TUI can't be
  scrolled natively. (#415)
- **`project_search` moved from admin-only to dual-auth + `memory:read`
  scope**, so integrations can search project memory. (#413)
- **Per-provider spawn parity**: codex bypass, antigravity memory CLI,
  and a default-model guard for integration-originated sessions. (#412)
- **Integration default-agent model is an explicit dropdown** rather than
  a free-text datalist, on both web (#411) and mobile (#410).

### Docs

- **README refresh**: reworked hero, added comparison + FAQ, and synced
  the 5-CLI provider list across all 10 translations. (#417)

## [v2.10.1], 2026-06-22

### Added

- **MCP servers reach Grok.** Grok Build sessions now receive opendray's
  enabled MCP registry (HashiCorp Vault, etc.), per-provider `mcp_servers`,
  integration-scoped servers, and the opendray-memory server, the same
  injection every other MCP-capable provider gets. opendray writes them
  into the project-scoped `<cwd>/.grok/config.toml` `[mcp_servers]` table,
  which Grok union-merges with your global `~/.grok/config.toml` (your
  personal servers are untouched). Previously Grok shipped with MCP
  injection disabled, so it could not see Vault or any other shared server
  the operator had configured. (#404)
- **Cortex-first knowledge framing.** The spawn banner now opens with a
  preamble telling the agent to consult opendray's injected cortex
  (`kb_*` pages) as the authoritative source first, treating any external
  mirror (Obsidian vault, wiki) as a secondary fallback used only when the
  cortex doesn't cover the topic. Stops agents from grounding infra/DB
  process answers in stale external notes when the curated copy is already
  in-context. (#406)
- **Current objective always injected.** Lean-mode spawns now inject the
  live `current_objective` body as a dedicated "work to THIS" block (not
  just an index entry the agent had to remember to fetch), plus a stronger
  proactive-maintenance directive so agents keep `current_objective`,
  the journal, and durable memory current on their own. (#403)
- **On-demand, section-level KB access.** `doc_read` and `project_search`
  can now pull a single heading-section of a large global knowledge page
  instead of the whole thing: a `kb_integrations` lookup drops from
  ~15K tokens to ~300–1.3K, and search hits carry a
  `doc_read(slug, section=…)` pointer instead of dead-ending on a teaser. (#400)
- **Cross-project distilled knowledge now applies.** Fixed the experience
  compiler reading session outcomes through an ephemeral table, which
  starved it of feedstock (112 journal summaries → only 2 survived) so it
  produced zero global playbooks. Outcomes are now denormalized onto the
  durable journal row (migration `0070`, with a one-shot backfill of
  historical rows), so the compiler sees the full corpus and its global
  playbooks auto-inject at spawn. (#402)

### Fixed

- **Grok provider icon.** Grok now shows its real brand mark in the spawn
  dialog and provider rail instead of the neutral letter-disc fallback. (#405)

## [v2.10.0], 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Antigravity multi-account.** Bind a session to a specific Antigravity
  (`agy`) login, switch accounts from the session header, and manage
  accounts in Providers → Antigravity (discovery + guided `HOME=… agy`
  login). Accounts are isolated by `$HOME`, the agy analogue of Claude's
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. **Switching accounts keeps the conversation:** agy
  stores each conversation as a portable per-`$HOME` SQLite db, so the
  switch copies the current conversation into the new account's HOME and
  resumes it (`--conversation <id>`). You continue the same chat on the
  other identity, only the credential/quota changes. Restarting an
  antigravity session resumes its conversation too. (#396)
- **Grok Build CLI provider.** xAI's `grok` as a first-class provider
  (install with `curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash`, then
  `grok login`; models `grok-build` / `grok-composer-2.5-fast`, bypass via
  `--always-approve`). Resolves exe/model/bypass generically: no per-CLI
  adapter code. (#397)
- **OpenCode local-endpoint diagnostics.** When a session's local endpoint
  (LM Studio / Ollama / vLLM) is unreachable or serves no chat-capable
  model, opendray now surfaces a one-time spawn notice explaining the cause
  (check the URL ends in `/v1`, the endpoint serves on the LAN, a chat
  model is loaded) instead of OpenCode's opaque `[buffer unavailable]`. (#398)

### Changed

- **Carry-context is ON by default when switching Claude accounts**, and
  rate-limit auto-failover now carries context too: a switch seeds the new
  account with a recap of the prior conversation instead of starting blank.
  Untick the toggle for a clean-slate switch. (#395)

### Removed

- **Gemini CLI provider retired**, superseded by Antigravity. Removed from
  the install wizard, the provider catalog/UI, the `opendray providers`
  npm-update list, and the Cortex "discuss with AI" list. Existing Gemini
  sessions and on-disk credentials are left untouched, but the provider is
  no longer offered to new installs. (#397, #399)

## [v2.9.1], 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Escalating a Cortex discussion now jumps straight into the spawned
  session and continues on the same CLI + account.** The escalated session
  surfaces immediately (web deep-links it via `?open=`, mobile pushes the
  route) instead of only appearing on the next manual list refresh. It also
  inherits the conversation's provider / model / Claude-account override
  rather than always falling back to Claude. (#390)

### Changed

- **Refreshed the third-party integration guide and its searchable
  `kb_integrations` KB page** to match the shipped v2.9.0 contract:
  `permission_mode` (`default` | `bypass`) replacing the old
  `bypass_permissions` boolean, the per-principal `integration:<id>` memory
  zone, the enforced `providers:write` / `providers:update` scopes, and the
  reserved `agent_id` field. Removes the stale `FORTHCOMING` framing so any
  AI or developer reading it gets the current contract. (#391)

## [v2.9.0], 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Per-integration spawn profile.** Each third-party integration now
  carries its own provider-agnostic spawn config (MCP servers, system
  prompt, and a permission-bypass toggle) decoupled from per-CLI args, so
  one integration behaves consistently across Claude / Codex / Gemini. (#381)
- **Per-integration default agent + first-class session model.** Choose the
  default agent and model an integration's sessions spawn with, from a
  dedicated web + mobile config UI. (#378, #379)
- **Native Select & Copy in the terminal.** Drag (or long-press on touch)
  to select any portion of the buffer (a command, a line-wrapped URL) and
  copy it, on both web and mobile. Replaces the old whole-buffer copy. (#374)
- **Claude account selector for AI discussion.** Cortex's Discuss With AI
  lets you pick which Claude account drives the discussion (web + mobile +
  i18n). (#385)
- **Remove (delete) session control** alongside Stop, so an ended session
  can be cleared from the list rather than only halted. (#387)
- **Mobile parity for integrations + project blueprint**, bringing the phone
  app level with the web admin's integration management. (#386)
- **Third-party integration guide + searchable `kb_integrations` KB page**:
  an authoritative, on-demand reference for wiring external callers. (#382)

### Changed

- **Integration-origin sessions are isolated** from the operator's session
  list and default to no memory capture, keeping third-party traffic out of
  the operator's working view. (#375, #376)
- **Retired the detected-URLs badge** on the terminal pane: native Select &
  Copy now covers the OAuth-login URL case the badge existed to rescue. (#388)

### Fixed

- **Third-party integration memory capture** is routed into per-integration
  zones instead of leaking facts into the operator's partition. (#380)
- **Backup pre-migration snapshots** auto-discover the newest `pg_dump` so a
  stale PATH default can't crash-loop migrations. (#383)
- **AI discussion on non-Claude providers** uses the correct per-CLI
  headless invocation (e.g. gemini `--prompt`, codex `exec`). (#384)

## [v2.8.0], 2026-06-16

### Added

- **OpenCode CLI provider.** Drive OpenCode (the open-source,
  provider-agnostic agentic coding CLI) through the same PTY gateway as
  Claude Code / Codex / Gemini. Point it at a local OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM) with just a base URL: opendray
  generates a per-session config, auto-discovers the endpoint's models so
  they all appear in OpenCode's `/model` picker, and wires the shared
  `opendray-memory` MCP, skills, and a spawn-dialog bypass toggle. (#369)
- **AI discussion model picker on mobile**, matching the web admin's
  cloud-agent + local-model selection in Cortex's Discuss With AI. (#368)
- **Antigravity** is now selectable as a cloud agent in Cortex's Discuss
  With AI. (#370)
- **Backup-hardening arc + Cortex memory/notes UX** integrated from beta:
  scheduled/fan-out backups across pluggable targets, pre-migration
  snapshots, and the conversational notes/knowledge maintenance surface. (#367)

### Changed

- **Recovery Kit clarity.** The dialog now states what the kit is for
  (disaster-recovery insurance, rarely needed), that each generation is an
  independent file sealed with its own password (nothing is stored, there
  is no master password), and that the password protects the file, not the
  gateway. Downloaded kits are named by key fingerprint + date so
  regenerating no longer silently overwrites a prior kit. (#371)

### Fixed

- Release announcements trigger via `workflow_run` instead of the release
  event. (#366)

## [v2.7.6], 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Carry context on Claude account switch (opt-in).** Switching a live
  session to another account starts a fresh conversation (Claude Code
  can't `--resume` across accounts). A new **"Carry over conversation
  context"** toggle in the account switcher seeds the new account's
  session with a recap of the prior conversation, read from the old
  transcript, injected into the system prompt. Off by default; the
  toggle's helper text is the consent surface, since carrying context
  sends prior conversation content to the provider under the new
  account. Automatic rate-limit failover never carries context. Also
  fixes the stale switch-confirm copy that still claimed history was
  preserved via `--resume` (removed in v2.7.x).
- **Release announcements auto-drafted for X.** Each published release
  now appends an "Announce on X" block to its GitHub release notes with
  a one-tap intent link composed from the CHANGELOG, and (when
  `TYPEFULLY_API_KEY` is configured) queues a Typefully draft.

### Fixed

- **Web self-update no longer dead-ends on live sessions.** When an
  in-app upgrade would interrupt running sessions, the gateway gates the
  restart behind a confirmation (the sessions auto-resume). The web
  About panel previously surfaced that gate as a raw error with no way
  forward; it now shows an **"Upgrade anyway"** prompt with the live-
  session count and proceeds on click.

## [v2.7.5], 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **iOS Safari: restored the contextual copy pill on terminal text
  selection** (regression from v2.7.3). PR #353 added `touch-action:
  pan-y` to `.xterm-viewport` so iOS scrollback worked with the
  clipped pane, but the same property claimed horizontal /
  diagonal gestures for the browser and broke xterm's selection-drag
  on iPad and iPhone: the pill (anchored at `pointerup` once a
  selection finishes) never appeared because `pointerup` arrived
  with no finished selection to anchor to. Dropped `pan-y` (the
  default `auto` is sufficient for iOS scrollback) and added a
  `touchend` belt-and-suspenders fallback so the pill anchors
  reliably even when iOS Safari's synthesised `pointerup` doesn't
  fire (or fires with stale coordinates) on canvas-internal events.

## [v2.7.4], 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Inspector: one-click download for files + zip-on-the-fly for
  folders.** Every row in the Files tree now carries a hover-revealed
  Download icon. Clicking it on a file streams the bytes as an
  attachment with the original filename (including unicode via RFC
  5987 `filename*=`); clicking it on a folder streams a built-on-the-
  fly zip archive of the visible subtree (hidden entries + symlinks
  skipped to match the tree's listing). `http.ServeContent` handles
  Range requests so resume works on large files; the zip builder
  walks deterministically and skips per-file permission errors
  instead of aborting the whole archive. Downloads are confined to a
  caller-supplied `root` (the session's cwd in the inspector) and
  the server EvalSymlinks-checks the resolved target stays inside
  it, so a hand-crafted URL can't exfiltrate files from outside the
  inspector's view even with a leaked admin token.
- **Plugins: drag-and-drop install of `SKILL.md`.** Drag a
  `SKILL.md` onto the Agent skills table and the daemon slugs the
  frontmatter `name:` into an id and writes it to `<vault>/<id>/
  SKILL.md`: no id prompt, no editor modal. Vault collisions return
  409; built-in collisions become overrides with the existing badge.
  i18n parity preserved across en/es/zh.

### Fixed

- **Web sessions: breathing room around the chat pane.** Slimmed
  the chrome (SessionTabs `h-9 → h-7`, WorkbenchHeader `h-14 → h-11`,
  avatar `36 → 28px`) and reserved a 12px bottom strip so Claude's
  input no longer sits flush against the browser bottom edge. Net
  result: chat-top moves up ~20px and typing feels less cramped on
  tall windows.

## [v2.7.3], 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Mac Safari terminal regressions** introduced in v2.7.2 by #323. The
  chat no longer extends past the browser bottom; Claude's TUI input
  wraps correctly past the visible right edge after 3-4 lines; and
  `[disconnected — reconnecting…]` stops stacking: it announces once
  per disconnect cycle, then prints `[reconnected]` on recovery or
  `[connection lost — refresh the page to reconnect]` after retries are
  exhausted. WebKit's `ResizeObserver` fires late on absolute-positioned
  elements nested inside flex containers, which left `fit()` reading a
  stale size after sidebar/banner shifts; the xterm host now stays
  in-flow with `contain: layout paint` instead. The WebSocket retry
  budget was also bumped (`maxRetries` 6 → 30, `maxBackoff` 8s → 15s)
  so an idle proxy bouncing the socket doesn't read as "broken forever."
- **iOS web terminal scrollback.** Two-finger drag on the terminal
  canvas now scrolls xterm's scrollback. `.xterm-viewport` got
  `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`, `overscroll-behavior: contain`,
  and `touch-action: pan-y`. The AppShell switched from `h-svh` to
  `h-dvh` so the layout tracks the live visual viewport (keyboard,
  address-bar) instead of locking to the address-bar-visible height.

### Added

- **Web: "update available" badge on the Settings icon.** A small
  accent dot appears on the gear in the sidebar (expanded, icon-rail,
  and mobile slide-over) when a newer release is detected, so the
  upgrade prompt finds operators instead of waiting for them to open
  About. Background poll every 6 hours, shares the `['version']` query
  cache with the existing AboutSection so a manual "Check now" updates
  the badge immediately. Suppressed while `pending=true` to avoid
  nagging during an in-flight upgrade. i18n parity preserved across
  en / es / zh.
- **GitHub Sponsors landing material.** `SPONSORS.md` (pitch, five
  tiers, FAQ, thank-you wall), `docs/sponsors/dashboard-copy.md`
  (paste-ready text for both the Opendray org and the navidrast
  personal Sponsors dashboards), and `.github/FUNDING.yml` updated to
  list both accounts.

## [v2.7.2], 2026-06-04

### Added

- **`opendray doctor` + `opendray setup-macos` (macOS).** `setup-macos`
  gives the binary a stable, per-machine self-signed code-signing
  identity (in a dedicated keychain, fully non-interactive) and re-signs
  it, so a one-time Full Disk Access grant survives rebuilds/updates
  instead of macOS re-prompting on every version change. `doctor` is a
  read-only health check that flags an ad-hoc signature or a config
  living in a TCC-protected folder. `opendray serve` with no `-config`
  now falls back to `~/.opendray/config.toml` (outside the protected
  folders) so a fresh install's gateway starts without a privacy prompt.
- **macOS release binaries are now Developer ID-signed + notarized**
  (when the signing secrets are configured), so a user's Full Disk
  Access grant persists across `opendray update`. Signing runs via quill
  on the Linux release runner and is a no-op when unconfigured.
- **Telegram `/peek` command + control-keyboard button** to re-send the
  selected session's latest output on demand; the docked control keyboard
  now refreshes on `/select` and `/start`.
- **Mobile: switch a running Claude session's account + agent-CLI update
  awareness.** Rebind a live session to a different account from the
  session screen (web parity), and see when a provider CLI has an npm
  update available. The session Tasks tab also reached web parity.
- **Spanish (es) translation** across web + mobile with in-app language
  switching, plus a CI translation-parity guard that fails the build on
  missing/extra keys.

### Changed

- **Telegram notifications consolidated** on `enabled` + `muted` + the
  repeat policy. The redundant `notify_enabled` switch and the
  per-topic `notify_on` picker were removed: an enabled, unmuted
  channel notifies once per round, and the web channel card gained the
  mute toggle that mobile already had.

### Fixed

- **Switching a Claude session's account no longer leaves it stopped and
  unrestartable.** The switch now starts a fresh conversation under the
  new account (a session UUID that account's CLI actually knows) instead
  of `--resume`-ing a UUID minted under the previous account, which
  failed with "No conversation found" and exited the process.
- Web terminal jitter caused by the page's scrollbar: the terminal pane
  is now isolated from `<main>`.
- Mobile: numeric Telegram `chat_id` is submitted as a number, not a
  string, so a Telegram channel configured from the phone starts.
- Release pipeline: release notes are written outside the work tree so
  goreleaser's dirty-tree check passes.

### Removed

- **`ghcr.io/Opendray/opendray` container image (all 370 versions / 84
  tags).** The image was orphaned: the most recent tag was `v2.1.0`
  (five releases behind), no workflow in `.github/` was building it
  any more, no docs / installer scripts / discussions referenced it.
  More importantly, a pullable container contradicted the host-
  resident-only deploy policy (Discussion #300, README "Choose how
  to run it" table): opendray runs AI CLIs through PTYs and shares
  filesystem state (`~/.claude`, ssh-agent, project files) with
  them, which container isolation breaks. Operators who landed on
  the GHCR page following stale links from external blog posts
  would have pulled v2.1.0 and hit exactly that failure mode.
  Supported install paths remain the
  [one-line installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Opendray/opendray/main/scripts/install.sh),
  the [from-source quickstart](docs/quickstart.md), and
  `npm install -g opendray`.

## [v2.7.1], 2026-06-01

Security + bug-fix rollup on top of v2.7.0. No API, config, or schema
changes. Drop in.

### Security

- **Path-traversal sanitiser bypass in NotesPanel** (#294).
  `replace(/\.\.\/+/g, '')` was bypassable by overlap (`....//`
  collapses to `../` after one pass). Replaced with split-on-slash +
  filter-out `..`/`.` + rejoin, which cannot be bypassed that way.
- **Windows path-traversal gap in `backup` local target** (#296).
  `filepath.IsAbs("/foo")` returns `false` on Windows, so the prior
  absolute-path reject left a gap. `LocalTarget.resolve()` now also
  rejects paths with a leading `/` or `\`, and rejects any colon on
  Windows to catch drive-relative forms like `C:foo` / `C:..\evil`.
- **Demo-client API key in log lines** (#294). The integration-key
  fingerprint embedded in two log sites was emitting bytes from the
  secret through `console.log`. Dropped the fingerprint entirely;
  `integration_id` already identifies which credential is in use.

### Fixed

- **Windows build failure in `internal/session`** (#296).
  `syscall.SIGTERM` / `syscall.SIGKILL` are undefined on Windows.
  New build-tagged `signals_{unix,windows}.go` helpers abstract the
  difference: Unix preserves the prior `SIGTERM → grace → SIGKILL`
  ladder; Windows falls through to `proc.Kill()` (TerminateProcess)
  since the platform has no SIGTERM equivalent. Documented in code.
- **`go test -race ./...` failing on Windows** (#296). Test compat
  across `auth`, `backup`, `cliacct`, `catalog`, `mcp`, `session`,
  `app` packages: `USERPROFILE` setenv alongside `HOME` for
  `os.UserHomeDir`, Unix-perm asserts skipped on Windows
  (`os.Chmod` doesn't enforce them there), symlink tests skip when
  `os.Symlink` lacks privilege, shell-script fake MCP server
  replaced with `TestMain`-as-fake-server pattern, `app_test.go`
  uses an existing file as fake parent dir for cross-platform
  `os.MkdirAll` failure. Full suite now passes on Windows
  (44 packages, 0 failures).
- **Identity-replacement no-op in NotesPanel** (#294).
  `prefix.replace(/\/$/, '/')` stripped a trailing slash and
  replaced it with the same slash: the author meant to *ensure* a
  trailing slash. Rewrote as
  `endsWith('/') ? prefix : prefix + '/'`.

### Docs

- **`README.fa.md` 10-way language switcher backfill** (#293). The
  Persian README still listed only English / 简体中文 / فارسی; now
  matches the ten-way switcher the other nine READMEs got via #282.
- **`enable-cli-updates.sh` discoverable from the failure path**
  (#297). The in-app guidance toast (returned when the npm global
  prefix is read-only by the service user) and `scripts/README.md`
  now name the helper script that resolves the situation, so
  operators don't have to grep for it. Closes #262.

## [v2.7.0], 2026-06-01

The Flutter mobile app catches up to web. Features that landed on the
web dashboard but never reached mobile are now at parity: Telegram
two-way channel config, Claude account metadata, a gateway version
check, and most-recently-used session ordering.

### Added

- **Telegram two-way channel config on mobile** (#290). The mobile
  channel form gained the five Telegram fields the web form already
  had: owner allow-list (`owner_user_ids`), two-way chat toggle
  (`chat_enabled`), typing indicator (`chat_typing`), activity
  notifications (`notify_enabled`), and reply length cap
  (`reply_max_chars`). Booleans render as switches and serialize to
  the same config shape the gateway expects.
- **Claude account metadata on mobile** (#290). The provider page now
  surfaces the gateway-decorated account fields (subscription tier,
  rate-limit tier, active session count, last-used time, and OAuth
  email) as inline chips, plus an identity-drift banner with an
  Accept action when the on-disk OAuth identity changed.
- **Gateway version check on mobile** (#290). The About screen shows
  the running gateway's version, commit, and whether an update is
  available, with a release-notes link. Read-only: the in-app
  self-update stays on web / the host shell.
- **Most-recently-used session ordering on mobile** (#290). The
  sessions list now sorts most-recently-opened first (recorded
  per-device, persisted across restarts), mirroring the web list;
  live sessions still group ahead of ended ones.

## [v2.6.0], 2026-06-01

Web/mobile gain a real PR detail surface and a read-only Issues
surface, both backed by the existing git provider plumbing. The
gateway binary is now also distributable via npm: `npx opendray`
runs without a Go toolchain on the box. Plus a small dropdown-
positioning fix and a handful of new README translations.

### Added

- **PR detail surface on web + mobile** (#279). Click into a pull
  request from the PR list to get description, status (open /
  merged / closed), CI check summary, head/base branches, author,
  and last-updated timestamp. Backed by the same `git.PullRequests`
  provider interface the list view already uses: no new API
  surface for the host, just a deeper read against what the
  provider returns.
- **Read-only Issues surface on web + mobile** (#281). List and
  detail views for repo issues, mirroring the PR layout: title,
  state, labels, assignee, body, comments thread. Read-only by
  design: issue creation/edit stays out of scope until the
  permission model around it is settled.
- **Distribute `opendray` as an npm package** (#280). `npm i -g
  opendray` or `npx opendray` now works: the package wraps the
  platform-appropriate binary from the GitHub release. Useful for
  operators on Node-heavy fleets who'd rather not script a curl
  install. The binary itself is unchanged; npm is just another
  delivery channel alongside the existing tarballs.

### Fixed

- **Dropdown menus clamped to the viewport** (#284). The account
  switcher and the session-action menu could overflow off the
  right edge of narrow viewports (sub-400px mobile, or a
  side-by-side desktop layout). Both now flip / clamp so the
  trailing edge stays inside the visible area.

### Docs

- **Seven additional README translations** (#282): Spanish, Brazilian
  Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Russian. The README
  switcher row at the top of every translation now lists ten
  languages.
- **Farsi (Persian) README translation** (#283), originally
  contributed by [Majid Allahverdi](https://github.com/devwithmj)
  in #278; brought to `main` via #283 after a cross-fork
  rebase-conflict workaround. See Credits.

## [v2.5.0], 2026-05-31

Phase 2 Tier A of the multi-Claude-account work: rate-limit-aware
auto-failover. A Claude session that hits its account quota can now
automatically switch itself to the next non-throttled enabled account,
with the conversation continuing seamlessly on the new identity. Plus
documentation polish around the release ceremony so the next operator
cutting a release doesn't have to re-discover today's gotchas.

### Added

- **Rate-limit auto-failover for Claude sessions** ([providers.claude]
  `auto_failover_enabled`, default false). `pumpStdout` scans each
  Claude session's PTY for the `You've hit your session limit · resets
  HH:MM (UTC)` banner. On a match:
  1. The current account is marked throttled-until-reset in an
     in-memory `ThrottleStore` (lazy GC of expired entries).
  2. `PickFailoverClaudeAccount` picks the next enabled non-throttled
     account by the same least-loaded heuristic auto-assign already
     uses.
  3. `SwitchClaudeAccount` runs end-to-end: transcript JSONL
     hard-linked, PTY respawned with `--resume`, conversation
     continues on the new identity.
  4. Bus events for observability: `session.auto_switched` on
     success, `session.auto_failover_no_target` when the fleet is
     exhausted, `session.auto_failover_failed` when the switch
     itself errors.
  5s cooldown per session + 4 KiB rolling window so a persistent
  banner can't drive the regex on every chunk. Opt-in by design:
  defaults off so existing operators aren't surprised by silent
  account switches.
- **`RELEASING.md` runbook at the repo root** documenting the release
  ceremony end-to-end: the chain diagram, the "tag-after-changelog-
  merges" gotcha, recovery procedures (empty release body, pulled-
  back release), pre/post-release checklists, roadmap to
  release-please automation and pre-release `-rc.N` channels.

### Tests

- **Pinned contract: disabled accounts are excluded from auto-assign.**
  A regression-safety unit test for the `enabled<2` guard in
  `PickAutoAssignClaudeAccount`. The SQL filter
  (`WHERE ca.enabled = true`) and the explicit-pin validation path
  were already covered by live integration + handler tests; this
  closes the last gap.

### Internal

- New `ClaudeAccountResolver` interface methods:
  `MarkClaudeAccountThrottled`, `IsClaudeAccountThrottled`,
  `PickFailoverClaudeAccount`. `pickLeastLoaded` SQL gains variadic
  `exclude ...string` (parameterized via `NOT (ca.id = ANY($1::text[]))`).

### Config

- New: `[providers.claude] auto_failover_enabled` (default false).
  Opt-in for the runtime rate-limit-driven account switching.

### Honest limitations of Tier A

- Banner-text fragile: if Claude rephrases the limit message, the
  regex needs updating. Fallback separators (`-`, `|`) for the middle
  bullet are already covered.
- No predictive load spread: only reacts to hard limits. Tiers B
  (active probing) and C (local HTTPS proxy) from the design
  discussion remain available as upgrades.
- Sessions running on the empty-id default (`~/.claude`) are skipped
  by the failover path for the MVP, mapping the default to a real
  account row needs a resolver round-trip we haven't exposed yet.
  After auto-assign kicks in for ≥2 enabled accounts, most new
  sessions are pinned to a named account anyway, so this gap shrinks
  to zero in practice.

## [v2.4.0], 2026-05-31

Multi-Claude-account UX, two-way Telegram channel, and a clutch of
session-quality fixes. The big new capability: a single OpenDray
gateway can now manage multiple Anthropic identities side-by-side and
let an operator switch a live Claude session between them without
losing the conversation.

### Added

- **Claude accounts: filesystem watcher.** `~/.claude-accounts/<name>/`
  is now monitored with fsnotify; a new `.credentials.json` (the
  result of `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=… claude login`) registers an account
  row automatically. 500ms debounce, backoff-on-error reattach loop,
  symlink rejection at every level.
- **Claude accounts: synthetic `default` row.** `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
  (the CLI's own home) now surfaces as a row named `default` so the
  primary identity is visible in the panel without forcing the
  named-account login flow.
- **Claude accounts: capacity chips.** Each row now shows
  `subscription_type`, `rate_limit_tier`, `active_sessions`,
  `last_used_at`, and `oauth_email`, all derived server-side from
  `<configDir>/.credentials.json` + `<configDir>/.claude.json` + a
  single JOIN against the sessions table. No new chrome.
- **Claude accounts: least-loaded auto-assign at session create.**
  When `POST /sessions` arrives with provider=claude and empty
  `claude_account_id` (and ≥2 accounts are enabled), the gateway
  picks the enabled account with the fewest non-terminal sessions
  (alphabetical tiebreaker). Removes the "everything piles onto
  default" bias. Explicit operator pin still wins.
- **Claude accounts: identity drift detection.** First-seen
  `oauthAccount.emailAddress` per account is recorded under
  `~/.opendray/cliacct-identity.json` (chmod 0600). On every List/Get,
  the current on-disk email is compared; mismatch surfaces
  `identity_drift=true` and `previous_email` on the Account row,
  rendered as a red "identity changed: was X · accept" chip.
  `POST /api/v1/claude-accounts/{id}/accept-identity` updates the
  baseline so the chip clears.
- **Session switch preserves conversation.**
  `PATCH /api/v1/sessions/{id}/claude-account` now hard-links the
  Claude transcript JSONL from `<old_config_dir>/projects/<workspace>/
  <session_id>.jsonl` into `<new_config_dir>/projects/<workspace>/`
  before respawning. Claude `--resume` then finds and replays the
  conversation under the new account. Hard-link shares one inode so
  switching back-and-forth keeps both views synchronized.
- **Telegram: two-way conversational chat.** Typing indicator, turn
  replies, persistent control keyboard acting on the current session,
  configurable from the dashboard.
- **Catalog: warn + confirm before CLI upgrade.** The in-app CLI
  upgrade button now warns when sessions are using the CLI it's about
  to replace, with a new `scripts/enable-cli-updates.sh` helper for
  the non-root install path.
- **Web: MRU session ordering + Cmd/Ctrl+K palette search**.

### Changed

- `claude_account_id` validation is now enforced at session create
  AND at switch: bogus or disabled ids return HTTP 400 BEFORE the
  row is persisted (create) or BEFORE the live PTY is stopped (switch).
- Default idle threshold raised 30s → 5m so long-running tool
  invocations don't get killed by the idle reaper.
- The "Switch Account" confirmation dialog now says "conversation
  history is preserved" instead of "in-progress conversation state
  will be lost", accurate description of what now happens.

### Fixed

- `token_filled` previously only checked the legacy
  `<accountsDir>/tokens/<name>.token` file, so every config-dir
  account (the documented flow!) showed "NO TOKEN YET" despite having
  working credentials. Now reports true when either source has usable
  credentials.
- Gemini reply parsing now reads `chats/*.jsonl` instead of scraping
  the screen, eliminating screen-dump noise in Telegram forwards.
- Session 'shell' provider's chrome stripper is now shell-aware so
  raw prompt characters don't leak into the channel forwarders.
- Web: copy now works over plain-HTTP LAN (Clipboard API requires
  HTTPS otherwise), terminal selection-driven copy works, copy pill
  is anchored at the selection with neutral styling.

### Security

- All disk reads in the cliacct path use `os.Lstat` and reject
  symlinks (`<accountsDir>/<name>/`, `<configDir>/.credentials.json`,
  `<configDir>/.claude.json`, the legacy token file). Defense in
  depth against an attacker who can write under the accounts tree.
- `migrateClaudeTranscript` Lstat-rejects symlinked sources before
  `os.Link` so a planted symlink can't be hardlinked into the new
  account's tree and read as conversation history by `claude --resume`.
- Telegram inbound is gated to the configured owner across all
  message types, not just control commands.

### API

- New: `POST /api/v1/claude-accounts/{id}/accept-identity`: clears
  the identity-drift baseline by recording the current on-disk email
  as the new accepted identity.

### Config

- New: `[providers.claude] watcher_enabled` (default true). Set to
  false to disable the fsnotify watcher; the Import-local button
  still works on demand.

## [v2.3.4], 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **Language toggle in the web Topbar moved its checkmark but UI
  strings didn't switch.** The zustand → i18next bridge ran as a
  module-level `useLocale.subscribe(...)` in `i18n.ts` that mounted
  before React. Under React 19 StrictMode + Vite HMR + zustand persist
  hydration the subscription could end up registered against a store
  snapshot React never re-reconciled with, so picking a language moved
  the dropdown's checkmark (which reads from the store) without
  triggering `i18n.changeLanguage()`. Moved the bridge into a
  `<LocaleSync />` React effect under `QueryClientProvider` so it
  shares the same lifecycle as every other `useTranslation()`
  consumer and they update in lockstep (#267).

- **Nine UI strings rendered their placeholders literally**:
  "update available → {{version}}", "Suggested ({{count}})", "Updated
  {{from}} → {{to}}", "connected · {{count}} tools", and the three
  About-panel version-toaster lines all showed the `{{var}}` template
  instead of the substituted value. The web i18next interpolation is
  configured for single-brace `{name}` but those particular keys were
  authored with the i18next default `{{name}}`. Normalized them across
  both locales (#261).

- **Mobile `flutter build apk` failed with hundreds of parser errors
  after slang codegen.** Mobile's slang config uses
  `string_interpolation: braces` (matching the web) but the same
  `{{var}}` typos that produced literal placeholders on web produced
  invalid Dart on mobile (`({required Object {version})` and
  `${{version}}`) that wouldn't compile. Same normalization as #261,
  plus a refresh of the generated `strings*.g.dart` outputs and
  alignment of `app/mobile/pubspec.yaml` to the product version
  (#264).

### Changed

- **App icons now show the new wooden-cart wordmark glyph instead of
  the old pink-gradient "D".** README was already updated to the
  opendray.dev wordmark, but the running surfaces (web favicon,
  Android launcher mipmaps, the full iOS `AppIcon.appiconset`, and
  the repo-root `assets/icons/logo/` set) hadn't caught up, so a
  fresh install showed the new brand on GitHub and the old brand on
  the device. Regenerated every square icon surface from a single
  1024×1024 source so proportions stay consistent across sizes
  (#266).

- **The Providers page now asks for confirmation before upgrading a
  CLI that has live sessions on it.** Linux file-replacement
  semantics mean an already-loaded session keeps the old binary in
  memory, but a long session with lazy / dynamic imports or in-flight
  subprocess work can pick up new code mid-run. When `n > 0`
  non-terminal sessions are using the provider, clicking Update opens
  a dialog with the count and an honest explanation of the trade-off;
  with no live sessions Update still fires immediately, as before.
  Update-check responses also stay fresh for an hour now (matching
  the server-side npm cache) instead of being re-fetched on every tab
  switch (#263).

## [v2.3.3], 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **About panel showed no version and the self-update button did
  nothing.** The dashboard called the version / self-update API at
  `/version` and `/version/update` instead of `/api/v1/...`, so the
  requests 404'd. Added the `/api/v1` prefix (#251).

## [v2.3.2], 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **Cross-session memory injection rendered every fact as `- ---`.**
  The "Recent project memory" banner took the first line of each
  memory, which for frontmatter-authored facts is the `---` YAML
  delimiter. It now skips the frontmatter and surfaces the
  `description` (falling back to the first body line) (#250).

## [v2.3.1], 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **Copy buttons silently failed over plain HTTP (LAN IP / mobile).**
  `navigator.clipboard` is only exposed in a secure context. Added a
  shared `copyText()` helper that falls back to `execCommand('copy')`
  and routed the existing copy callsites through it (#249).

## [v2.3.0], 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Live sessions were destroyed by a daemon restart (e.g. a
  self-update).** Sessions are now marked `interrupted` on a gateway
  shutdown and auto-resumed on the next startup via their stored agent
  session id (`--resume`), with bounded-concurrency spawning and an
  optional `OPENDRAY_AUTO_RESUME_MAX` cap. A drain gate warns before a
  self-update interrupts running work (#247).
- **404 page instead of the login screen after a restart.** The 401
  redirect now respects the dashboard base path (→ `/admin/login`)
  and keeps `next` router-relative (#248).
- **Brand icons broke under a non-`/admin` base path** (#246).

## [v2.2.2], 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Memory: global-scope injection fallback + recency default**, a
  fact told to one session surfaces in another regardless of cwd
  (#244).
- **Transport-aware MCP editor template + "unsupported" badge for
  Codex** (#242).

### Fixed

- **Memory endpoints are now scope-gated** (admin or
  `memory:read` / `memory:write`) (#245).

## [v2.2.1], 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Always-visible "Check for updates" + re-install action in the
  About panel** (#243).

### Fixed

- **Remote MCP URL normalization** (#230).

## [v2.2.0], 2026-05-22

### Added

- **In-dashboard update notification + one-click background
  self-update** (#241).
- **Startup warning when W^X (MemoryDenyWriteExecute) blocks
  executable memory** (#240).

### Changed

- **Repository renamed `opendray_v2` → `opendray`** across
  code/config/docs; install / uninstall URLs updated (#238, #237).

### Fixed

- **Dropped `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`** from the systemd unit: it
  broke Codex / Gemini sessions (#218).

## [v2.1.1], 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Responsive mobile web layout**: slide-over nav + inspector with
  edge handles (#236).

### Fixed

- **Telegram channel:** handle `/start`, and a clearer `/list` header
  for terminated sessions (#235).

## [v2.1.0], 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Per-provider model management from the dashboard** (#229).
- **Real CLI version + "update available" surfaced in the providers
  API/UI** (#227).
- **Interactive session switching via `/select` + Talk-to buttons**
  in channels (#226).
- **Validate MCP servers from the Plugins page** (#233).
- **Windows installer: a true one-liner**: auto-installs WSL2 +
  Ubuntu, runs the installer, and persists across reboot (#213).

### Changed

- **Hardened the merged Update action**: provider mutations are gated
  and the update path degrades gracefully (#234).

### Fixed

- **Session list shows session names in `/list` instead of bare ids**
  (#224).
- **Spawned CLIs get a color-capable `TERM`** so Claude/Codex/Gemini
  render in color (#225).
- **macOS installer hardening**: robust local Postgres provisioning,
  configured-port binding, idempotent launchd reload, bash 3.2
  compatibility, and a launchd PATH that finds brew-installed CLIs
  (#208, #209, #211, #212, #231, #232).
- **Windows installer:** OS-build guard, auto-resume after a WSL
  reboot, PowerShell 5.1 compatibility (#214).
- **Installer:** validate DB identifiers and don't abort on a free /
  commented-out Postgres port (#210).

### Security

- **Scrubbed dev-internal docs + personal-network references from the
  public repository** (#204).

## [v2.0.5], 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Flutter mobile session terminal now has the URL detector
  badge.** Same model as the web admin: the PTY byte stream is
  scanned for http(s) URLs with the same state-machine extractor
  that re-assembles CLI-soft-wrapped OAuth URLs. A floating pill
  in the top-right corner of the terminal: primary tap opens the
  most recent URL in the OS browser via `url_launcher`, secondary
  `⋯` button opens a bottom-sheet with every URL (newest first)
  for picking older ones. Closes the OAuth-on-Flutter-app gap
  reported alongside the web fix.

### Changed

- **Web login no longer pre-fills the username with "admin".** The
  install wizard lets operators pick any username, so seeding the
  field forced everyone-who-didn't-keep-the-default to backspace
  before typing. The field is now empty by default and autofocused.

## [v2.0.4], 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **URL extractor now re-assembles CLI-soft-wrapped URLs.** AI CLIs
  (claude-code, codex, gemini) hard-wrap long OAuth URLs at the
  terminal column width by emitting literal `\n` characters every
  ~55 chars. The v2.0.1 / v2.0.2 / v2.0.3 extractor used a `[^\s]+`
  regex that stops at `\n`, so it captured only the first wrapped
  segment (e.g. `https://...&client_`). Tapping the badge opened a
  truncated URL, the OAuth provider rejected it, and the operator
  couldn't authenticate.

  The extractor is now a state-machine walker that anchors on
  `https?://`, consumes URL-body characters, and treats a single
  internal `\n` as a soft-wrap when the current line is ≥ 40 chars
  long (matches real CLI wrap width; well above "<intro phrase>\n
  <url>" prose patterns). Paragraph breaks (`\n\n`), single
  newlines followed by non-URL characters, and short prose lines
  still terminate the URL correctly.

  Verified against the actual 450-char claude-code OAuth URL that
  was failing in production: extractor now produces ONE complete
  URL (vs. two truncated segments).

## [v2.0.3], 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Terminal URL badge always opens with one tap, regardless of how
  many URLs the session has accumulated.** v2.0.2 made the `N = 1`
  case one-tap, but real sessions usually have ≥ 2 URLs by the time
  the auth flow runs (the CLI's welcome banner often prints a docs
  link before the OAuth URL), and that fell back to the two-tap
  dialog flow. The badge now ALWAYS opens the **most recent** URL
  on a single tap, which is the OAuth URL in 100% of the
  `claude login` / `gemini auth login` / `codex login` cases.

  Multi-URL access stays available via a small `⋯` button beside
  the primary anchor: tapping it opens the same list dialog as
  before, so operators can still grab an older URL when they need
  it. The dialog row Open buttons are also real anchors (not
  `window.open()`) for the same popup-blocker reason.

  This is a web-admin-only fix. The Flutter mobile app's terminal
  surface doesn't have URL detection yet. Separate follow-up.

## [v2.0.2], 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Service-control subcommands**: `opendray start`, `opendray stop`,
  `opendray restart`, `opendray status`. Thin wrappers over
  `systemctl` (Linux) and `launchctl` (macOS) so operators don't
  have to remember the platform-native incantation. On Linux, the
  binary auto-prepends `sudo` if the caller isn't root. On macOS,
  defaults to the user LaunchAgent (`gui/$UID/com.opendray.opendray`);
  pass `--system` to target the LaunchDaemon scope.

### Fixed

- **One-tap link open for the OAuth URL badge.** When a session has
  exactly one detected URL (the common AI-CLI auth case: `claude
  login` / `gemini auth login` / `codex login` each print one OAuth
  URL), the floating "🔗 1 link" badge is now itself an
  `<a target="_blank">`: a single tap goes straight to the
  browser, no intermediate dialog. The dialog still appears when
  ≥ 2 URLs are detected, so multi-link sessions still get the
  disambiguating UI. In the dialog, the "Open" button is also a
  real anchor now, which avoids popup-blocker gating on some
  mobile browsers.

## [v2.0.1], 2026-05-18

### Removed

- **Docker deployment path.** opendray is a host-resident gateway:
  it spawns AI CLIs via PTYs and shares process state (`~/.claude`,
  ssh-agent, project files) with them, which is incompatible with the
  container isolation a production Docker deploy would impose.
  Removed `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.test.yml`,
  `.dockerignore`, `.env.example`, the GHCR push job from the release
  workflow, and the Docker-Compose sections from README / docs.
- **In-app Tutorial page.** All 84 markdown sections plus
  `Tutorial.tsx` removed; docs now live in a dedicated repo that will
  publish independently. Sidebar entry, `/tutorial` route, and i18n
  keys (`nav.tutorial`, `web.providers.claudeAccounts.tutorialTooltip`,
  `web.providers.claudeAccounts.architectureLink`) removed in parallel.

### Fixed

- **"No Claude accounts" empty state** (Providers page + Spawn dialog,
  web + mobile) now tells operators the actual setup path: spawn a
  session and run `claude login` in the terminal. The previous wording
  pointed at the gateway-host shell workflow (works only for SSH-
  capable operators) and incorrectly implied a system
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` fallback. The shell workflow remains available
  in the Providers page text for power-users juggling multiple
  identities; it's just no longer the headline instruction.

### Changed

- Brand: web favicon, docs hero, iOS `AppIcon.appiconset` (15 sizes),
  Android mipmap (5 densities), and `app/mobile/assets/brand/`
  launcher source refreshed from a new canonical set in
  `assets/icons/logo/`. Now tracked in-repo so a future refresh is
  one `cp` + the existing `sips` resize loop.

### Added: install / uninstall / update tooling

Lifecycle scripts and binary subcommands that grew out of a fresh-
LXC end-to-end install test. Everything below is `curl | bash`–
reachable, idempotent, and works on Linux (Ubuntu / Debian) +
macOS; Windows is funneled through WSL2.

- **One-line installer wizard** (#185 #186)
  - `scripts/install.sh`, dual-mode entry: dispatches to the OS
    installer in a local checkout, or shallow-clones the repo and
    re-execs when piped from `curl`.
  - `scripts/install-linux.sh`, apt + systemd; walks the operator
    through Postgres (existing or fresh `postgresql-16` +
    `pgvector` install), AI-CLI choice, admin credentials, listen
    address, release-tarball binary install, schema migration,
    and a hardened systemd unit. Optional `--from-source` builds
    the binary + web bundle from a checkout instead.
  - `scripts/install-macos.sh`, brew + LaunchAgent (or
    `--launchd-daemon` for system-wide), same flow. Detects Apple
    Silicon vs Intel for the right release asset.
  - `scripts/install-windows.ps1`, PowerShell helper for WSL2:
    detects existing WSL, otherwise prints the install command +
    reboot guidance, then hands off to the Linux installer
    inside Ubuntu.
- **One-line uninstaller** (#191)
  - Default mode stops + removes the gateway runtime but keeps
    `config.toml`, data directory (bcrypt keyfile, sessions,
    notes, vault), logs, and the PostgreSQL database, so a
    re-install picks up where you left off.
  - `--purge` (or `OPENDRAY_PURGE=1`) drops the DB + role,
    deletes config / data / logs, removes the service user.
  - Post-purge verification step: walks the standard install
    paths and bails loudly with `ls -la` output if anything
    survived. "No trace left" gets *checked*, not assumed.
- **`opendray update` subcommand** (#194)
  - Fetches the latest GitHub release, picks the goreleaser
    asset matching this host's `GOOS/GOARCH`, verifies SHA-256
    against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, then atomically replaces
    `/proc/self/exe` via temp+rename.
  - Flags: `--check` (probe only), `--force` (re-install same
    version), `--yes` (skip confirm), `--restart` (`systemctl
    restart opendray` after replace, Linux only).
  - Fails fast with a "try with sudo" hint when it can't write
    the install directory, no silent no-op.
- **`opendray providers <list|update>`** (#194)
  - Detects installed AI CLIs (`claude`, `gemini`, `codex`),
    prints versions + paths.
  - `update` re-runs `npm install -g` per CLI; `--check` shells
    out to `npm view <pkg> version` to compare current vs
    npm-latest.
  - `--only claude,gemini` restricts to a subset; `--json` on
    `list` for scripted consumers.

### Security

- **Secrets out of `config.toml`** (#192). The wizard now writes
  the database URL + admin bootstrap password to a separate file:
    - Linux: `/etc/opendray/opendray.env` (mode `0640 root:opendray`),
      consumed by systemd via `EnvironmentFile=`.
    - macOS: `~/.opendray/opendray.env` (mode `0600`), consumed
      by a tiny launcher wrapper (`~/.opendray/bin/opendray-launcher.sh`)
      that the LaunchAgent's `ProgramArguments` invokes: launchd
      has no `EnvironmentFile` equivalent.
  - `config.toml` is now `0644` and contains only non-secrets
    (listen, log config, `[admin].user`, runtime data dir).
  - Existing opendray env-var override layer
    (`OPENDRAY_DATABASE_URL`, `OPENDRAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, etc.)
    does the actual wiring, no Go changes needed.

### Fixed (install wizard, all reported during the LXC walkthrough)

- `curl | bash` prompts work, wizard re-attaches stdin to
  `/dev/tty` so EOF on the pipe doesn't make every `read` fail
  under `set -e` (#187).
- `run_priv -E …` / `run_priv -u …` no longer trip "command not
  found" when running as root, new `run_priv_env` /
  `run_priv_as` helpers handle both root + non-root paths (#188).
- pnpm moved to the `--from-source` branch only; default-path
  Node install no longer hangs on corepack's silent download
  (#189).
- AI CLI install shows npm's progress bar instead of `--silent
  >/dev/null` (so a 90-second download doesn't look like a hang)
  (#189).
- Admin login works after install: wizard writes `[admin].user`
  in addition to the password; matches opendray's auth contract
  (#190).
- Customisable admin username (was hard-coded to "admin") (#190).
- Final-summary URL resolves the host's LAN IP for `0.0.0.0`
  listens instead of printing the `<this-host>` placeholder
  (#190).
- Colour codes render in the summary block, colour vars use
  ANSI-C quoting so heredoc interpolation carries real ESC
  bytes (#190).
- `uninstall --purge` deletions are unconditional now; survived
  the previous flag-gated logic that occasionally left
  `config.toml` on disk (#192).
- Env-var alternative for the purge flag (`OPENDRAY_PURGE=1
  bash`) that survives `bash -s -- --flag` paste-newline weirdness
  (#193).

### Documentation

- README hero: typographic v2 logo + status / license / CI /
  GHCR badges + "What is opendray?" five-bullet section + paired
  EN / ZH `README.md` / `README.zh.md` (#180 #181 #182).
- One-liner install / uninstall snippets at the top of
  `## Install` on both READMEs (#186 #192 #193).
- `docs/getting-started.md` (+ `.zh.md`), 15-minute end-to-end
  walkthrough that mirrors what the wizard does (#183).
- `docs/operator-guide.md` strengthened on Docker-deploy scope,
  decision-question framing makes the "no session spawn" limit
  unmissable (#184).
- `scripts/README.md` documents the wizard, file layout (now
  including the secrets / config split), troubleshooting table,
  and the env-var alternatives for the purge / yes flags.

### Branding

- Unified launcher icons across web favicon, iOS
  `AppIcon.appiconset` (15 sizes), and Android mipmap densities
  (5) using the cropped typographic v2 logo (#182).

## [v2.0.0], 2026-05-17

### Versioning realignment

- **Re-tagged from the previous `v1.0.0` tag** (issue #165). The
  major version now reflects this codebase's identity as the second
  generation of the opendray product (`opendray_v2`). The previous
  `v1.0.0` tag was deleted (had three duplicate draft releases on
  GitHub, all deleted; no published release; no downstream
  installers depend on it).
- New [VERSIONING.md](./VERSIONING.md) documents the
  major-as-generation policy and what triggers future bumps.

### Added

- Per-session bypass toggle in the Spawn dialog (mobile + web).
  Provider-aware: Claude → `--dangerously-skip-permissions`,
  Codex → `--ask-for-approval never`, Gemini → `--yolo`. Off by
  default; the previous all-or-nothing provider config setting
  still works for "always bypass" deployments.

### Changed

- Spawn dialog's Claude account picker now appears immediately on
  open (mobile + web). Previously it waited for the operator to
  re-tap the provider dropdown because the parent state's
  provider id stayed unset.
- When 2+ Claude accounts are registered, the `Default (env /
  system)` option disappears from the Claude account picker; the
  first enabled account auto-selects. Single-account setups
  retain the Default option.

### Fixed

- Release workflow's `ghcr` job now produces image tags on
  `workflow_dispatch`. `docker/metadata-action` was reading
  `github.ref` (a branch when dispatched manually), so `type=semver`
  rules emitted zero tags and buildx failed with "tag is needed when
  pushing to registry". Each rule now passes `value=${{ env.TAG }}`
  so the same ruleset works for both `push:tags` and
  `workflow_dispatch` entry points.

### Added

- Release workflow gains a `ghcr` job that builds the multi-arch
  Dockerfile (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) and pushes to
  `ghcr.io/opendray/opendray` on every tag release. Job-scoped
  `packages: write` (the parent `release` job stays at
  contents+id-token least-privilege). Tag set covers `:1.0.0`,
  `:1.0`, `:v1.0.0`, plus `:latest` for non-prerelease semver.
  SHA-pinned actions throughout, matching the existing release-
  pipeline pattern.

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`, automated release pipeline.
  Triggers on `v*` tag push (or manually via workflow_dispatch with a
  tag input). Produces a goreleaser draft release with:
    * cross-compiled archives (linux/darwin × amd64/arm64) +
      `SHA256SUMS`
    * cosign keyless OIDC signatures (`SHA256SUMS.sig`,
      `SHA256SUMS.pem`) via Sigstore Fulcio, no long-lived key
    * SPDX SBOM via anchore/sbom-action
  Permissions limited to `contents: write` (release upload) and
  `id-token: write` (cosign OIDC). Supply-chain hardening: SHA-pinned
  cosign-installer, sbom-action, and goreleaser-action; fail-fast
  tag-format validation on workflow_dispatch.
- `deploy/` directory with reference deploy artefacts:
  - `deploy/systemd/opendray.service`, production-ready systemd unit
    with sandboxing (`NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, etc.),
    `migrate`-then-`serve` startup, 20s graceful-stop window.
  - `deploy/lxc/proxmox-pty-notes.md`, Proxmox-specific guide covering
    privileged vs unprivileged container PTY behaviour, the cgroup +
    bind-mount config required for unprivileged LXCs, networking +
    pgvector + pg_dump-version checks, and a pre-go-live checklist.
  - `deploy/README.md`, index pointing operators at the right artefact
    for their topology.
  - operator-guide.md "Where to look next" section now links to `deploy/`.
- ADR 0016 (Proposed): backup-format v2 design for per-install PBKDF2
  salt. Captures the four binding decisions (in-header storage,
  version-byte bump 1→2, per-Seal salt provenance, indefinite v1
  read compat) and the three-PR rollout. Implementation pending.
- LICENSE file (Apache 2.0), previously declared in README only.
- SECURITY.md, threat model, default posture, deployment checklist, report channel.
- CONTRIBUTING.md, dev setup, test commands, PR + commit conventions.
- CHANGELOG.md, this file.

### Changed
- `internal/backup/cipher.go`: 6-line comment on `kdfSalt` flagging it
  as a frozen v1 protocol constant and pointing at ADR 0016. No code
  behaviour change.
- Renumbered ADR `0011-memory-subsystem.md` → `0014-memory-subsystem.md` to
  resolve the duplicate-0011 collision with `0011-channel-rich-content-and-bridge.md`.
  Updated cross-references in README, ADR 0013, and the embed-onnx stub.

First stable release. Tagged at commit `fe96fd8` on `main`. Web frontend
+ backend feature-complete; mobile + Slack inbound + automated release
workflow deferred to v1.x per the post-v1.0 roadmap. v1
(`Opendray/opendray`) keeps running in production through this quarter
per ADR 0001.

The feature inventory below was originally captured under
`[v1.0-rc] — 2026-05-05`; section was promoted to `[v1.0.0]` on tag.

### Added (since the greenfield start)

- **M0, composition root:** `internal/app/`, config loader (`internal/config/`),
  pgx pool + hand-rolled migration runner (`internal/store/`), event bus
  (`internal/eventbus/`), structured logging via slog.
- **M1, sessions:** PTY lifecycle, ring-buffer streaming, WS handler,
  resume-via-reconnect (per ADR 0003).
- **M2, CLI catalog:** provider manifests + per-id user config
  (`internal/catalog/`).
- **M2.5, admin auth:** bearer tokens with constant-time password compare
  and 24h TTL (`internal/auth/`).
- **M3, integrations:** external-app registry, `/api/v1/proxy/{prefix}/*`
  reverse proxy, integration call log (`internal/integration/`, ADR 0006,
  ADR 0010).
- **M4, channels:** channel hub + Telegram, Slack, Discord, DingTalk,
  Feishu, WeChat, WeCom (`internal/channel/`, ADR 0005, ADR 0011-channel).
- **Memory:** built-in pgvector cross-CLI memory layer
  (`internal/memory/`, ADR 0014). Three-CLI mirror keeps Claude / Codex /
  Gemini transcripts aligned. ONNX local-embedding optional via
  `-tags local_onnx`.
- **Ambient memory:** auto-capture from active sessions + auto-injection
  on session start (ADR 0013).
- **Backup + export:** AES-256-GCM encrypted PostgreSQL dumps,
  S3/WebDAV/SFTP/rclone targets, admin export/import bundles
  (`internal/backup/`, ADR 0012).
- **Web admin (W0–W5):** React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui +
  TanStack Router/Query + Zustand + xterm.js. Single SPA bundled into
  the Go binary via `go:embed` (ADR 0007, ADR 0008).
- **Events stream:** admin-bearer-authed `/api/v1/integrations/_events`
  WebSocket (ADR 0009).

### Deferred to post-v1.0

- Slack inbound (M5+).
- Deploy automation (release toolchain, goreleaser, Dockerfile,
  systemd unit) lands in a follow-up PR.
- e2e Playwright harness.
